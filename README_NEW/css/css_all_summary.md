File-by-File Summaries
css/admin-skin.css
• Source MD file name: admin-skin.css-analysis.md
• Role (short sentence): This file acts as the primary "skin" stylesheet, applying a consistent, branded, and modern look and feel to the entire Booking Calendar administrative interface.
• Key Technical Details (hooks, DB, etc.): Pure CSS file containing no PHP code or WordPress hooks. It includes a clearly defined "New design 2.0, 2.1" section. It uses CSS Flexbox for the top navigation tabs (.wpdvlp-top-tabs) and includes @media (max-width: 782px) queries for mobile responsiveness. It also contains rules to hide standard WordPress notices to prevent UI clutter.
• Features (Admin vs User):
    ◦ Admin: Provides the custom look for the two-tier tabbed navigation, ensures consistent toolbars, styles data-rich tables (including row highlighting), and enables a responsive admin UI.
    ◦ User: Has no effect on the user-facing side of the website.
• Top Extension Opportunities: The recommended method is to create a separate, custom CSS file and enqueue it with a later priority to override existing rules safely. Developers building extensions should reuse existing classes (e.g., .wpdevelop, .control-group) for visual consistency.
• Suggested Next Files (from that MD):
    1. includes/page-resource-free/page-resource-free.php
    2. js/datepick/jquery.datepick.wpbc.9.0.js
    3. css/calendar.css
css/admin.css
• Source MD file name: admin.css-analysis.md
• Role (short sentence): This general-purpose stylesheet acts as a foundational layout layer for the main settings pages and provides component-specific styling and WordPress compatibility fixes within the admin panel.
• Key Technical Details (hooks, DB, etc.): Pure CSS file with no PHP code or WordPress hooks. A major feature is the introduction of a modern, flexbox-based, two-column layout for settings pages (.wpbc_settings_flex_container). It includes styles for visual hierarchy in resource dropdowns and styles shortcodes as selectable badges. It also contains overrides for "WordPress 5.3 Fix" styles.
• Features (Admin vs User):
    ◦ Admin: Enables the responsive, two-column settings page layout, enhances the usability of complex forms, provides clearer shortcode display, and ensures UI consistency.
    ◦ User: Has no effect on the user-facing side of the website.
• Top Extension Opportunities: Safely override styles by creating a separate custom CSS file with a later priority. Developers can reuse layout classes, such as .wpbc_settings_flex_container, to match the plugin's modern structure in their own admin pages.
• Suggested Next Files (from that MD):
    1. includes/page-resource-free/page-resource-free.php
    2. js/datepick/jquery.datepick.wpbc.9.0.js
    3. css/calendar.css
css/calendar.css
• Source MD file name: calendar.css-analysis.md
• Role (short sentence): This is the foundational stylesheet for the front-end booking calendar, responsible for the core structural layout and default appearance of the calendar grid.
• Key Technical Details (hooks, DB, etc.): Purely presentational CSS. The core layout uses CSS Flexbox (flex-flow: row wrap) for a responsive multi-month grid. It utilizes modern CSS features like aspect-ratio: 1 / 1 for square date cells and @container queries for font size adaptation in narrow containers. Complex check-in/check-out day displays are handled using inline SVG polygons styled by the CSS.
• Features (Admin vs User):
    ◦ Admin: None.
    ◦ User: Enables the responsive multi-month grid, ensures square date cells, styles changeover day displays, defines the calendar legend, and sets the structure for date tooltips.
• Top Extension Opportunities: The safest way to customize is to override the defined CSS Custom Properties (variables) in a separate custom stylesheet. For structural changes, enqueue a custom stylesheet after the plugin’s styles and use more specific selectors.
• Suggested Next Files (from that MD):
    1. includes/page-resource-free/page-resource-free.php
    2. js/datepick/jquery.datepick.wpbc.9.0.js
    3. css/skins/** (Directory)
css/client.css
• Source MD file name: client.css-analysis.md
• Role (short sentence): This stylesheet defines the layout and appearance for the front-end booking form, including form fields, buttons, and post-submission elements.
• Key Technical Details (hooks, DB, etc.): Purely presentational CSS. It extensively uses CSS Flexbox to define responsive form layouts (e.g., centered, two-column). It features a modern button system using clamp() for responsive sizing and uses SVG data URIs for polished payment gateway buttons. It also incorporates critical accessibility features like clear focus states (blue box-shadow).
• Features (Admin vs User):
    ◦ Admin: None.
    ◦ User: Provides responsive booking form layouts, professional styling for all form elements, clear user feedback (error/success messages), a polished confirmation page, and visual availability hints.
• Top Extension Opportunities: Create a separate custom stylesheet to override rules, especially to change colors for buttons or messages. Developers should reuse plugin classes like .wpbc_button_light or .wpbc_fe_message_info when injecting custom elements.

css/wpbc-gutenberg.css
• Source MD file name: css_wpbc-gutenberg.css-analysis.md
• Role (short sentence): This file styles the visual previews of Booking Calendar blocks within the Gutenberg editor to provide a what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) experience for content administrators.
• Key Technical Details (hooks, DB, etc.): Purely presentational CSS; no PHP, hooks, or direct WordPress API interactions. It targets classes like .wpbc_gb_block_preview_* to define block dimensions and structure. It leverages the core Gutenberg class .is-selected to conditionally display UI elements, such as the configuration button.
• Features (Admin vs User):
    ◦ Admin: Enables visual block previews (form, calendar, timeline), manages contextual controls (configure button visibility), and styles the display of the underlying raw shortcode.
    ◦ User: Has no effect on the public-facing side of the website.
• Top Extension Opportunities: Use a separate admin stylesheet loaded after the plugin’s to safely override preview styles. To add new UI elements or functionality, the companion JavaScript file (js/wpbc-gutenberg.js) must be modified first.
• Suggested Next Files (from that MD):
    1. js/wpbc-gutenberg.js
    2. js/wpbc_times.js
    3. css/wpbc_time-selector.css
css/wpbc_time-selector.css
• Source MD file name: css_wpbc_time-selector.css-analysis.md, wpbc_time-selector.css-analysis.md
• Role (short sentence): This file styles the front-end interface that displays available time slots as a user-friendly, responsive set of buttons.
• Key Technical Details (hooks, DB, etc.): Purely presentational file; no PHP or WordPress API interaction. It uses Flexbox (display: flex, flex-flow: row wrap) on the main container (.wpbc_times_selector) to arrange and wrap time-slot buttons. It defines a critical state class, .wpbc_time_picker_disabled, which applies a distinct red background and cursor: not-allowed.
• Features (Admin vs User):
    ◦ Admin: None.
    ◦ User: Creates a responsive grid of time-slot buttons, provides clear visual feedback on availability, and styles informative messages when no times are available.
• Top Extension Opportunities: Customize appearance using a theme stylesheet to override the colors of the time slots. Adding a new visual state, such as a "selected" style, requires modifying the controlling JavaScript (js/wpbc_times.js) to apply the new class.
• Suggested Next Files (from that MD):

    2. js/wpbc_tinymce_btn.js
    3. js/user-data-saver.js

css/wpbc_ui_both.css
• Source MD file name: css_wpbc_ui_both.css-analysis.md
• Role (short sentence): This utility stylesheet provides a collection of reusable, consistent loading indicators (spinners) and blur effects for use in both the front-end and back-end interfaces.
• Key Technical Details (hooks, DB, etc.): Pure CSS file, with application driven by JavaScript. It implements blur effects (.wpbc_calendar_blur) using the filter: blur() property and prevents interaction using pointer-events: none. It defines multiple types of pure CSS spinners (.wpbc_spins_loader, _mini, _micro) using efficient CSS @keyframes for rotation.
• Features (Admin vs User):
    ◦ Admin: Loaders are likely used on admin pages (Bookings, Settings) when AJAX is fetching or saving data.
    ◦ User: Loaders are commonly used during front-end calendar navigation while new month availability data is fetched from the server.
• Top Extension Opportunities: The colors of the hard-coded spinners can be easily overridden in a separate stylesheet to match the site’s branding. Alternatively, the entire loader system could be replaced with more modern SVG-based animations for improved visual quality.
• Suggested Next Files (from that MD):

    3. js/wpbc_phone_validator.js
css/modal.css
• Source MD file name: modal.css-analysis.md
• Role (short sentence): This file is a dedicated stylesheet that styles all modal dialogs (pop-ups) used for complex administrative tasks within the plugin.
• Key Technical Details (hooks, DB, etc.): Purely presentational CSS. It uses a very high z-index to ensure visibility over all other admin content. It uses Flexbox to structure content inside modals (e.g., aligning toggle switches). The file includes responsive @media queries (especially @media (max-width: 782px)) that force complex, multi-column forms to stack vertically on mobile devices.
• Features (Admin vs User):
    ◦ Admin: Styles the Shortcode Builder Modal (for TinyMCE), the Google Calendar Import Modal, the Print Modal, and the Payment Request Modal, ensuring a consistent and usable experience.
    ◦ User: This is an admin-only stylesheet and has no effect on the user-facing side of the website.
• Top Extension Opportunities: Customize modal appearance by creating a separate custom CSS file and loading it with a late priority on admin pages. Developers creating custom features requiring a modal should reuse existing classes (e.g., .wpbc_popup_modal, .modal-body).

    3. css/skins/** (Directory)
css/skins/multidays.css
• Source MD file name: multidays.css-analysis.md
• Role (short sentence): This file provides a specific "Multidays" color scheme for the front-end calendar by overriding the base structural styles defined in calendar.css.
• Key Technical Details (hooks, DB, etc.): Purely presentational CSS, containing no layout or structural rules. It defines a color-coded palette for date statuses: bright green (.date_available), reddish-orange (.date_approved), and yellow/orange (.date2approve). It correctly styles the SVG polygons used for check-in/check-out days and uses a CSS Custom Property for consistency.
• Features (Admin vs User):
    ◦ Admin: Defines specific styling (striped background) for unavailable dates on the admin "Availability" page.
    ◦ User: Provides a distinct calendar theme and ensures clear visual states for availability using strong color contrast.
• Top Extension Opportunities: This file is a perfect template for creating new custom skins. Developers can copy this file, change the color values for the various status classes, and upload it to /wp-content/uploads/wpbc_skins/ to have the plugin automatically detect and use it.
• Suggested Next Files (from that MD):

Common Features and Patterns
The analyzed stylesheets reveal several consistent architectural and technical patterns across the Booking Calendar plugin:
1. Purely Presentational Architecture: All analyzed files are written entirely in CSS and are purely presentational, containing no PHP code, WordPress hooks, or database interaction. Their functionality relies on JavaScript dynamically applying class names to the HTML generated by PHP functions.
2. Modern Layout Paradigm (Flexbox): The plugin makes extensive and sophisticated use of CSS Flexbox (display: flex) for constructing complex, modern layouts across both the admin and front-end. Examples include the admin navigation tabs, the modern settings page layout, the responsive multi-month calendar grid, front-end form layouts, and the time-slot selector.
3. Layered Theming and Skinning: The plugin separates structure from appearance. Structural CSS (like css/calendar.css) defines the layout, while specialized skin files (like css/skins/multidays.css) provide the distinct color schemes by overriding the base styles.
4. Responsive Design: All major UI components incorporate responsive design, typically using @media (max-width: 782px) to ensure functionality on tablets and mobile devices. The front-end calendar (css/calendar.css) uses the advanced @container queries for robust adaptation in narrow spaces.
5. Standardized Extension Method: The universally recommended method for safe customization across all files is non-destructive overriding. Developers are advised to create separate, custom CSS files and enqueue them with a later priority to prevent changes from being lost during plugin updates. Direct file modification is strongly discouraged.
Extension Opportunities
The analysis provides several methods for customizing and extending the plugin's appearance and functionality:
• Safe CSS Overrides: The top recommended method for general styling is to create a custom CSS file and enqueue it on the appropriate front-end or admin page with a later priority to override existing rules. This is ideal for changing colors (buttons, links, active states) or minor structural adjustments.
• Custom Calendar Skins: A highly effective way to theme the front-end calendar is to use an existing skin file (like css/skins/multidays.css) as a template, modify the color definitions, and upload the new file to the /wp-content/uploads/wpbc_skins/ directory. The plugin automatically detects the new theme.
• Reuse of Existing Classes: Developers should reuse layout and component classes—such as .wpbc_settings_flex_container (admin layout), .wpdevelop (admin UI components), .wpbc_button_light (front-end buttons), or .wpbc_popup_modal (modal structure)—to maintain visual consistency when developing new features or admin pages.
• Enhancing Dynamic Features (CSS + JS): For features controlled by JavaScript (Gutenberg blocks, time selectors), adding new visual states (e.g., a .wpbc_time_picker_selected class style) requires modifying the controlling JavaScript (js/wpbc_times.js) to apply the class, followed by adding the corresponding CSS rules.
• UI Enhancement (Spinners): A specific suggested improvement is replacing the pure CSS loading indicators defined in css/wpbc_ui_both.css with more modern, smoother SVG-based animations to enhance the user experience during AJAX operations.
