CharacterTypeBrief BioBooking Calendar PluginPrimary EntityThe core WordPress software that provides booking and availability management features. Its architecture is characterized by a strong separation between structural CSS (calendar.css), utility CSS (ui_both.css), and themed CSS (skins like multidays.css).New Design System (v2.0 / v2.1)Design SystemA significant UI refresh for the plugin's administrative interface. It introduced flat design, Flexbox for navigation, and a modern aesthetic to replace older/legacy styles in the admin panel.WordPress 5.3 FixCompatibility EffortA set of CSS overrides implemented to ensure the plugin's UI components (buttons, inputs) maintained their intended appearance and consistency following a change in core WordPress styling.CSS FlexboxLayout TechnologyA foundational "actor" used extensively across both the front-end and back-end. It is responsible for creating responsive, two-column layouts (admin settings), multi-month calendar grids, and wrapping time-slot buttons.Gutenberg EditorThird-Party IntegrationWordPress's modern block editor. The plugin actively integrates with it via dedicated CSS (wpbc-gutenberg.css) to provide content administrators with a visual (WYSIWYG) editing experience for booking blocks.TinyMCE (Classic Editor)Third-Party IntegrationThe classic WordPress editor. The plugin maintains backward compatibility and provides features like the Shortcode Generator modal, which received a modern UI update around 2024.jQuery Datepick (v9.0)Core LibraryThe un-analyzed, low-level JavaScript library that forms the engine of the calendar. It is responsible for rendering the date grid and applying the CSS classes that the base styles (calendar.css) and skins (multidays.css) rely on.Booking ResourcesCore Data Model (Un-analyzed)The fundamental bookable items within the plugin (e.g., rooms, services, time slots). The sources emphasize that understanding how they are managed (via files like page-resource-free.php) is key to understanding the plugin's core functionality.
