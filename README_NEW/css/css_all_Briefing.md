Detailed Briefing Document: Booking Calendar Plugin CSS Architecture
This document synthesizes the analysis of various CSS files within the Booking Calendar plugin, detailing its architectural approach to styling the administrative interface, the front-end user experience, and its commitment to modern, responsive design.

The plugin employs a layered, component-based CSS architecture heavily reliant on Flexbox for layout and dedicated stylesheets for specific functions (e.g., modals, time selection, calendar grid, administration).

1. Core Architectural Themes
A. Modern UI Refresh (Admin Panel)
The plugin has undergone a significant and recent UI overhaul, marked by the use of modern CSS techniques and clearly segmented styling:

Layered Admin Styling: The backend look and feel is created by combining foundational layout styles (admin.css) with specific branded theming (admin-skin.css).
New Navigation Systems: Both files reference new design systems:
admin-skin.css contains a "New design 2.0, 2.1" section, revamping navigation with .wpdvlp-top-tabs and .wpdvlp-sub-tabs. The active top tab is indicated with a simple, thick bottom border: border-bottom: 4px solid #1e7bc7;.
admin.css introduces a modern, flexbox-based, two-column layout for settings pages, using .wpbc_settings_flex_container and a vertical navigation menu in the left column.
Conflict Management: To ensure a clean admin experience, admin-skin.css actively hides standard WordPress notices that appear after the plugin's custom header, likely "to prevent UI clutter or layout conflicts from other plugins' messages."
B. Front-End Responsiveness and Advanced CSS
The user-facing components, particularly the calendar and forms, use advanced, modern CSS for superior performance and adaptability.

Flexbox for Layout: The core layout of the calendar grid (calendar.css) and all booking form variations (client.css) are built on CSS Flexbox (display: flex;).
calendar.css uses flex-flow: row wrap on .datepick-inline to enable responsive multi-month grids.
client.css uses Flexbox to create different form themes, such as the two-column layout in .wpbc_form_right, which then "stacks vertically on smaller screens."
Modern Techniques: calendar.css uses cutting-edge CSS features:
Square Cells: It uses the modern property aspect-ratio: 1 / 1; on .datepick-days-cell to ensure all date cells are perfectly square.
Container Queries: It employs container queries (@container wpbc_c__datepick-one-month (inline-size < 140px)) to allow the font size inside a single month block to shrink if placed in a very narrow container (e.g., a sidebar), making it "more robust than standard media queries."
Time Selection Usability: The time slot selector (wpbc_time-selector.css) is styled as a responsive grid of buttons using Flexbox and provides clear visual feedback via .wpbc_time_picker_disabled for unavailable slots.
C. Consistent UI Feedback and Utilities
The plugin uses a dedicated utility stylesheet to ensure consistent visual feedback across the entire application (admin and client-facing).

Shared Utilities (css_wpbc_ui_both.css): This file provides reusable loading indicators (spinners) and blur effects. Loaders are pure CSS, animated using @keyframes.
Loading State UX: The most common use case is for calendar navigation, where the container is blurred (.wpbc_calendar_blur) and a spinner appears "while the availability data for the new month is fetched from the server."
Modern Messaging: On the client side, the message system (client.css) uses a colored border-left to indicate message type (info, success, warning, error), which is "consistent with modern UI patterns."
2. Key Components and Specific Implementations
ComponentFileKey Implementation Details & QuotesCalendar Base Layoutcalendar.cssDefines the structural grid, using Flexbox and aspect-ratio: 1 / 1; for square date cells. It also manages the sophisticated display of check-in/check-out days using inline SVG polygons within the date cells.Calendar Theming (Skinning)multidays.cssOverrides base colors to create a theme (e.g., bright green for available, reddish-orange for approved). This file is noted as a perfect "template for creating a new custom calendar skin" by changing specific color values.Admin Page Layoutadmin.cssProvides foundational layout, including a sticky, vertical navigation menu for the settings pages. It styles dropdowns to create a visual hierarchy for resources (parent resources are bold, children are indented).Admin UI Brandingadmin-skin.cssProvides the branded look, standardizing UI elements within the .wpdevelop namespace. It uses a Bootstrap technique to collapse borders on button groups: margin:0 0 0 -1px !important;.Modal Dialogsmodal.cssStyles all admin pop-ups (shortcode generator, Google Calendar import). It uses a very high z-index to ensure visibility and includes media queries to force complex forms to "stack vertically" on mobile devices.Gutenberg Editorcss_wpbc-gutenberg.cssStyles the WYSIWYG preview of Booking Calendar blocks in the editor. It leverages the core Gutenberg class .is-selected to conditionally display UI elements like the "Configure" button only when the user is actively editing the block.Booking Formsclient.cssStyles forms, buttons, and confirmation pages. Features professional styling for payment gateway buttons using "SVGs embedded as data URIs" to display provider logos (Stripe, PayPal).3. Extension and Customization Guidance
The analysis consistently emphasizes that direct modification of the plugin's CSS files is not recommended due to the risk of changes being lost during updates.

A. Recommended Extension Method
The safest and most recommended approach across all components is to:

Create a separate, custom CSS file.
Enqueue it on the relevant pages (admin or front-end) with a later priority than the plugin’s stylesheets.
Use more specific CSS selectors to override the default rules.
B. Specific Risks
Flexbox Dependency: Modifying layout-related properties (e.g., display: flex, flex-flow) is risky and "could easily break the form's structure and responsiveness" (Client and Calendar analysis).
Complex Overrides: Overriding styles for new design features (like the flexbox navigation in admin-skin.css) requires care to avoid breaking the responsive behavior.
4. Next Steps Summary
The CSS analysis phase is now complete. The remaining un-analyzed files suggest the next priority should shift to understanding the plugin's core data structure and client-side interactivity:

includes/page-resource-free/page-resource-free.php: This is repeatedly identified as the "most important remaining file." It will define how "booking resources"—the fundamental bookable items—are created and managed, which is essential to understanding the plugin's core data model.
js/datepick/jquery.datepick.wpbc.9.0.js: This is the core, low-level JavaScript library that powers the calendar. Analysis will reveal how the calendar grid is rendered, how date selection works, and how the critical CSS classes targeted by the skins are applied.
Client-Side Logic: Files like js/wpbc_times.js (time selection logic) and js/user-data-saver.js (client-side data caching) should be analyzed to understand the interactivity of the booking form.
