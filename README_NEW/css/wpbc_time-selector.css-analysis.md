# File Analysis: `css/wpbc_time-selector.css`

## High-Level Overview

This stylesheet is dedicated to styling the front-end time-slot selection interface of the Booking Calendar plugin. When a user selects a date in the calendar that has available time slots, this CSS file controls the layout, appearance, and responsiveness of those choices.

Its primary role is to transform a list of times into a user-friendly, clickable set of buttons. It uses modern CSS (Flexbox) to create a clean, wrapping row of options that adapts to different screen sizes. This file is critical for the user-facing experience, as it directly impacts the usability and aesthetics of the core booking process.

## Detailed Explanation

This is a purely presentational file and does not interact with any PHP or WordPress APIs. It styles the HTML structure that is dynamically generated by the plugin's client-side JavaScript (`js/wpbc_times.js`) based on the availability for a selected day.

Key CSS selectors and their purposes:

-   **`.wpbc_times_selector`**: The main container for the time slots. It is a flex container (`display: flex`) that arranges the time slots in a row (`flex-flow: row wrap`) and allows them to wrap onto new lines as needed. The `gap` property ensures consistent spacing between the buttons.

-   **`.wpbc_times_selector div`**: This selector targets each individual time-slot button. Key properties:
    -   `flex: 1 1 auto`: Allows the buttons to grow and shrink to fill the available space, creating a justified layout.
    -   `max-width: Min(250px, 100%)`: Prevents the buttons from becoming excessively wide on larger screens while ensuring they don't overflow their container.
    -   `cursor: pointer`: Provides a visual cue that the element is clickable.

-   **`.wpbc_time_picker_disabled`**: A crucial state class. When a time slot is unavailable, this class is likely added via JavaScript. The CSS then applies a distinct red background (`#dc3400`) and a `cursor: not-allowed` property, giving the user clear feedback that the slot cannot be selected.

    ```css
    .wpbc_times_selector div.wpbc_time_picker_disabled:hover,
    .wpbc_times_selector div.wpbc_time_picker_disabled {
        cursor: not-allowed;
        color:#fff;
        background: #dc3400;
    }
    ```

-   **`@media (max-width: 400px)`**: A media query to ensure the time slots are usable on small mobile devices. It forces the buttons to take up more width, preventing them from becoming too compressed.

-   **`.wpbc_no_time_pickers`**: This styles the message that appears when no time slots are available for a selected day (e.g., "All times are booked"). It's styled to look like a disabled, informative block.

## Features Enabled

This file has **no effect** on the WordPress admin menu or any other back-end pages.

### User-Facing

This file directly implements and enhances the user-facing booking form:

-   **Responsive Time-Slot Buttons**: It creates a modern, responsive grid of time-slot buttons that is easy to use on both desktop and mobile devices.
-   **Clear Visual States**: Provides immediate visual feedback for available vs. unavailable time slots, improving usability and reducing user error.
-   **Informative Messaging**: Styles the fallback message for when no times are available, ensuring the user is never left with a blank or confusing interface.

## Extension Opportunities

-   **Safe Extension**: The recommended way to customize these styles is to use your theme's stylesheet or a custom CSS plugin to override the default rules. The classes are specific and easy to target. For example, you could change the color scheme to match your site's branding:

    ```css
    /* Custom style for disabled time slots */
    .wpbc_times_selector div.wpbc_time_picker_disabled {
        background: #a0a0a0; /* Change from red to gray */
    }
    ```

-   **Potential Risks**: Directly editing `wpbc_time-selector.css` is not advisable, as your changes will be lost upon a plugin update. Removing or significantly altering the flexbox properties (`display`, `flex-flow`) could break the button layout entirely.

-   **Adding Functionality**: To add new features, such as a "selected" state style, you would first need to modify the controlling JavaScript (e.g., `js/wpbc_times.js`) to add a `.wpbc_time_picker_selected` class when a user clicks a button. Then, you would add the corresponding styles in your custom stylesheet.

## Next File Recommendations

1.  **`js/wpbc_tinymce_btn.js`**: This file implements the plugin's integration with the classic WordPress editor (TinyMCE). It's valuable for understanding how the plugin maintains backward compatibility and provides a consistent user experience for those not using the Gutenberg block editor.
2.  **`js/user-data-saver.js`**: This file's name suggests it handles the client-side saving or caching of data that a user enters into the booking form. This could be a mechanism to prevent data loss on reloads or to pre-fill information, making it an important part of the form's overall usability.
3.  **`includes/page-settings-form-options/page-settings-form-options.php`**: This file appears to be responsible for the admin settings page where users configure the booking form fields. Understanding this file is key to learning how the plugin allows for form customization and how those settings are saved and used.
