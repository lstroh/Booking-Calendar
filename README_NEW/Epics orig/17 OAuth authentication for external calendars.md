Great choice ‚Äî let‚Äôs break down **‚ÄúSecurity ‚Üí Integration Security ‚Üí OAuth authentication for external calendars‚Äù** into clear, checkable items so you can verify whether a plugin is handling OAuth securely with **Google Calendar API / Microsoft Outlook API**.

---

## üîç Breakdown Into Checkable Items

### 1. **OAuth Flow Implementation**

* [ ] Does the plugin use **OAuth 2.0 authorization flow** (redirecting user to Google/Microsoft for login/consent)?
* [ ] Are **client ID and secret** managed securely (not hardcoded in plugin code)?
* [ ] Is the **redirect URI** correctly registered with Google/Microsoft (no open redirects)?




### 2. **Token Handling**

* [ ] Are **access tokens** stored securely (encrypted in WordPress DB, not plain text)?
* [ ] Are **refresh tokens** used for long-term access (so user doesn‚Äôt need to log in daily)?
* [ ] Does the plugin implement **token expiry handling** (refresh before expiry, re-authenticate when invalid)?
* [ ] Can tokens be **revoked manually by admin** (disconnect account)?




### 3. **Scope & Permissions**

* [ ] Does the plugin request **only required scopes** (e.g., `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events` rather than full `calendar` access)?
* [ ] For Outlook, does it use minimal Graph API scopes (e.g., `Calendars.ReadWrite` not `User.ReadWrite.All`)?
* [ ] Is the scope request **visible to the user/admin** during consent?




### 4. **API Communication Security**

* [ ] Are all API calls made over **HTTPS**?
* [ ] Are OAuth credentials (client secret, tokens) **never exposed in front-end code or logs**?
* [ ] Does the plugin validate **API responses** (avoid injection/spoofing)?



### 5. **Error & Recovery Handling**

* [ ] If OAuth login fails (expired token, revoked access), does the plugin **prompt admin to reconnect**?
* [ ] Are OAuth errors **logged securely** (without exposing sensitive info)?
* [ ] Does the system **fall back gracefully** (bookings remain intact even if sync fails)?



### 6. **Admin Experience & Control**

* [ ] Is there a **secure settings page** in WP admin to connect/disconnect Google/Outlook accounts?
* [ ] Can admins **see which accounts are connected** and when last sync happened?
* [ ] Can admins **revoke access** from within WP without editing DB?



### ‚úÖ Success Criteria

* OAuth 2.0 flow is implemented using **secure redirects + minimal scopes**.
* Access & refresh tokens are **stored securely and refreshed automatically**.
* Admins can **connect, disconnect, and monitor** external calendar accounts.
* Plugin handles **errors and token expiry** without breaking booking system.
* No OAuth secrets or tokens are **leaked in logs, code, or front-end**.

üëâ Do you want me to also prepare a **step-by-step testing checklist** (like ‚ÄúConnect Google Calendar ‚Üí inspect DB for token storage ‚Üí check scopes requested ‚Üí revoke token and see behavior‚Äù) so you can hands-on validate if a plugin truly follows this?
