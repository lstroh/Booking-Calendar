Got it ‚Äî let‚Äôs break down **‚ÄúSecurity ‚Üí Integration Security ‚Üí Secure APIs for calendar and CRM integrations‚Äù** into clear, checkable items so you can verify whether a WordPress plugin is handling API security correctly.

---

## üîç Breakdown Into Checkable Items

### 1. **Authentication & Authorization**

* [ ] Does the plugin use **OAuth 2.0** (not basic auth or API keys in plain text) for Google/Outlook/CRM connections?
* [ ] Are **access tokens** stored securely (e.g., in the WordPress options table with encryption, not in plain DB fields)?
* [ ] Are **refresh tokens** handled properly to avoid repeated re-logins?




### 2. **API Communication Security**

* [ ] Are all API requests made over **HTTPS (TLS 1.2 or higher)**?
* [ ] Are requests **signed or validated** (e.g., with HMAC, JWT, or OAuth signatures)?
* [ ] Are responses from APIs **validated** to prevent injection or spoofing?

### 3. **Scope & Least Privilege**

* [ ] Does the plugin request only the **minimum required scopes** from Google, Outlook, Zoho, HubSpot?
  (e.g., `calendar.readonly` instead of full account access).
* [ ] Can admins **review or revoke scopes** granted?



### 4. **Token & Credential Management**

* [ ] Are API keys, tokens, or secrets **never exposed in the client-side code** (JS, HTML)?
* [ ] Are credentials stored in **WordPress secure storage** and not hardcoded?
* [ ] Is there a **token rotation mechanism** (refresh tokens automatically renewed without downtime)?




### 5. **Error & Failure Handling**

* [ ] Does the plugin handle **API request failures gracefully** (e.g., no data corruption in bookings if sync fails)?
* [ ] Are errors logged securely (without leaking sensitive tokens/keys in logs)?
* [ ] Are admins notified if integrations **fail repeatedly** (e.g., expired token)?



### 6. **Data Protection During API Sync**

* [ ] Is booking/customer data **encrypted during transfer** to CRM/Calendar APIs?
* [ ] Are sync payloads **limited** to necessary fields (no oversharing of PII)?
* [ ] Can admins configure which data fields are sent to external systems?



### 7. **Admin Controls**

* [ ] Is there a **secure setup screen** where admins connect integrations (no raw copy-paste of secrets)?
* [ ] Can admins **disconnect integrations** at any time and revoke tokens?
* [ ] Is there an **audit log** of API calls (who/what data was synced, when)?



### ‚úÖ Success Criteria

* Plugin uses **OAuth 2.0** with secure token storage.
* All calendar/CRM API calls are **HTTPS only, signed, and scoped minimally**.
* Tokens and secrets are **encrypted, not exposed**, and rotated as needed.
* Failed API calls **don‚Äôt corrupt bookings** and are **logged securely**.
* Admins have **visibility and control** over integrations (connect, revoke, audit).

Do you want me to also create a **hands-on testing checklist** (e.g., ‚ÄúInspect DB for stored API keys,‚Äù ‚ÄúCheck if plugin requests excessive scopes,‚Äù ‚ÄúBlock HTTPS to see if requests still go through‚Äù)? That way you can directly verify a plugin‚Äôs security posture.
