Great — let’s break down **“Two-way client messaging (reply via SMS/email/portal)”** into **verifiable items** so you can check plugin implementation.

---

## **Requirements Breakdown**

### 1. Messaging Channels

* [ ] **Email**

  * Clients can reply to automated booking emails, and replies are captured in the system.
  * Admin can see the full conversation thread linked to the booking.

* [ ] **SMS** (via Twilio or similar)

  * Clients can reply to SMS reminders or updates.
  * Admin can view SMS replies in the booking’s conversation history.

* [ ] **Portal/Client Dashboard**

  * Clients can send messages directly from their portal/dashboard.
  * Admin can respond within the WordPress admin panel, linked to that booking.




### 2. Conversation Management

* [ ] All messages (email, SMS, portal) are **centralised** in a conversation view per booking.
* [ ] Conversation view shows **sender, timestamp, and channel**.
* [ ] Admin can **filter/search** messages by booking, client, or channel.
* [ ] Unread messages are flagged for admin attention.


### 3. Admin Controls

* [ ] Admin can **enable/disable** specific messaging channels (e.g., only email + portal).
* [ ] Admin can send **manual messages** from the dashboard (choose channel).
* [ ] Predefined templates (e.g., “On the way”, “Job complete”) can be inserted into conversations.
* [ ] Messages are linked to **specific bookings** for context.

### 4. Notifications

* [ ] Admin is notified when a client replies (dashboard/email alert).
* [ ] Clients receive notifications when admin replies.
* [ ] Notifications are **channel-aware** (reply via same method used).


### 5. Security & Compliance

* [ ] Messaging data is stored securely in the database (encrypted if sensitive).
* [ ] GDPR compliance: clients can request deletion of messaging history.
* [ ] Retention rules configurable (e.g., auto-delete messages after X months).
* [ ] Opt-out options for marketing but still allow **operational messaging**.


## **Success Criteria Checklist**

✅ Clients can reply to booking messages via at least one channel (email, SMS, or portal).
✅ Replies are captured in the system and linked to the correct booking.
✅ Admin sees full two-way conversation history with timestamps and channels.
✅ Multiple channels supported (email, SMS, portal).
✅ Admin can send both custom and template replies.
✅ System sends notifications for new replies.
✅ GDPR compliance (opt-out + retention rules) is respected.

👉 Do you also want me to outline a **“basic implementation” vs “advanced implementation”** split (e.g., Basic = email replies only, Advanced = full multi-channel hub with templates and retention rules)? That way you’ll know if the plugin is only partially covering this feature.
