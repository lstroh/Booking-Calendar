Perfect ‚Äî let‚Äôs break down **‚ÄúSecurity ‚Üí Data Protection ‚Üí Encrypted booking and payment data‚Äù** into concrete, checkable items so you can verify whether a WordPress plugin properly implements this.

---

## üîç Breakdown Into Checkable Items

### 1. **Transport-Level Encryption**

* [ ] Does the plugin **force HTTPS (TLS/SSL)** for all booking and payment pages?
* [ ] Are all API calls to external services (Stripe, PayPal, etc.) made over **HTTPS only**?

---

### 2. **Booking Data in Transit**

* [ ] Are booking form submissions sent via **secure POST requests** (no sensitive data in query strings)?
* [ ] Is client PII (name, email, phone, address, uploaded photos) **protected during transmission**?



### 3. **Booking Data at Rest**

* [ ] Is sensitive booking data (client details, addresses, notes) **encrypted in the database** (e.g., using AES)?
* [ ] If not fully encrypted, are at least **critical fields** (payment tokens, personal identifiers) encrypted or hashed?
* [ ] Does the plugin provide a **data retention policy** (delete old booking data after X days)?


### 4. **Payment Data**

* [ ] Does the plugin **store raw card details** (‚ùå should NOT happen)?
* [ ] Does it instead use **tokenization** via payment gateways (Stripe/PayPal/etc.) so only tokens are stored in DB?
* [ ] Are tokens and transaction IDs stored in a **secure, encrypted field**?

---

### 5. **Database Security**

* [ ] Are encryption keys **securely managed** (not hardcoded in the plugin code)?
* [ ] Does the plugin rely on **WordPress database abstraction** (wpdb with prepared statements) to prevent SQL injection?
* [ ] Is booking and payment data **segregated by user roles** (admins see more, staff see only necessary info)?




### 6. **Admin & API Access**

* [ ] Are booking and payment records accessible **only to authorized roles** (no leakage to all WP users)?
* [ ] Is data protected when exported (e.g., CSV exports encrypted or admin-only)?
* [ ] If using APIs, are requests **signed and verified**?




### 7. **Compliance Alignment**

* [ ] Does the plugin reference **PCI-DSS compliance** (for payments)?
* [ ] Does it state **GDPR-compliant handling** of encrypted booking data?
* [ ] Is there a **privacy/technical documentation** that confirms encryption methods used?



‚úÖ **Success Criteria:**

* All booking and payment data is transmitted over **HTTPS/TLS**.
* No raw payment details are stored; only **tokens from gateways** are kept.
* Sensitive booking and payment fields are **encrypted in the database**.
* Access is **role-restricted**, with logs/audits available.
* Plugin aligns with **PCI-DSS + GDPR compliance requirements**.

Would you like me to also make a **step-by-step testing checklist** (e.g., ‚Äúinspect database for raw card numbers,‚Äù ‚Äúsubmit booking and check if HTTPS enforced,‚Äù etc.) so you can actually test a plugin hands-on?
