Got it. Let‚Äôs break **‚ÄúSecurity ‚Üí Messaging Security ‚Üí End-to-end encryption for two-way messaging (Delighter, Effort 6, Priority Low)‚Äù** into **checkable items** so you can verify whether the plugin implements it:

### üîê End-to-End Encryption for Two-Way Messaging ‚Äì Breakdown

**1. Encryption in Transit (Basic Requirement)**

* Are all chat/messaging requests sent over **HTTPS (TLS 1.2+)**?
* Is there any protection against **man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks**?
* Do API/WebSocket connections also use **TLS**?



**2. End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) Support (True Delighter)**

* Does the plugin **encrypt messages on the sender‚Äôs device** before transmission?
* Are messages **only decrypted on the recipient‚Äôs device** (not on the server)?
* Does the plugin use a secure protocol for E2EE (e.g., **Signal Protocol, Double Ratchet, or PGP-like scheme**)?

**3. Key Management**

* Does each user have a **unique encryption key pair (public/private)**?
* Are private keys stored securely (e.g., encrypted at rest, not shared with the server)?
* Does the system support **forward secrecy** (new keys for each session/message)?




**4. Message Storage Security**

* If messages are stored on the server (e.g., for delivery), are they **stored in encrypted form**?
* Can only the intended recipients decrypt stored messages?


**5. Authentication & Integrity**

* Are messages **digitally signed** or protected with **HMAC** to ensure they‚Äôre not tampered with?
* Does the plugin prevent **spoofing or impersonation** of senders?



**6. External Messaging Integrations (if any)**

* If the plugin integrates with SMS, email, or WhatsApp, does it **maintain E2EE** or downgrade to transport-level encryption only?
* Is there a **clear warning** when messages are sent over non-encrypted channels?




‚úÖ **Success Criteria** (to confirm implementation):

* **Basic:** All communication over HTTPS/TLS.
* **Good:** Messages stored encrypted on server + encrypted database fields.
* **Full E2EE (Delighter):** Messages encrypted on sender‚Äôs device, only decrypted on recipient‚Äôs device, with strong key management and forward secrecy.

Would you like me to also **map this into a checklist format** (like Yes/No questions) so you can go line by line against a plugin‚Äôs documentation/settings?
