Excellent ‚Äî let‚Äôs break down:
**Security ‚Üí Data Protection ‚Üí Access control for job photos and client communication logs (Delighter, Effort 16, Priority Low, Consent required for storing photos)**
into verifiable **implementation checkpoints** for plugin auditing.

## üîê Access Control for Job Photos & Client Communication Logs ‚Äî Breakdown

### **1. Access Permissions & Roles**

* Does the plugin restrict **who can view job photos and client communication logs**?

  * Admin only
  * Assigned team members
  * Client (if shared)
* Can access be configured by **user role or team member permissions**?
* Are there **granular access rules** (e.g., only users assigned to a specific job can view its photos/logs)?
* Is there **role-based access control (RBAC)** or **capability mapping** built in?





### **2. Storage & Data Protection**

* Are photos and communication logs **stored in a secure, access-controlled directory** (not publicly accessible via URL)?
* Are uploaded photos stored using **obscured file paths or UUIDs**, not guessable URLs?
* Does the plugin store files in a **protected WordPress uploads directory** with `.htaccess` or equivalent restrictions?
* Are photos and logs **encrypted at rest** (optional but ideal for ‚ÄúDelighter‚Äù)?
* Are communication logs (messages, call notes, etc.) stored in **the same database** or a separate, more secure table?



### **3. Consent & Data Retention**

* Does the system request **client consent** before storing photos or communication logs?

  * e.g., checkbox during booking or in privacy policy acknowledgment
* Is there a **consent record** stored with the job or client profile?
* Can clients **request deletion** of their photos or logs in compliance with **GDPR / UK DPA**?
* Are there **retention rules** (e.g., auto-deletion after X months or job completion)?




### **4. Access Auditing & Logging**

* Does the plugin log **who accessed or downloaded** job photos or messages?
* Is there an audit trail for when photos or logs are created, edited, or deleted?
* Are access attempts (successful/failed) recorded for security review?



### **5. Sharing & Export Controls**

* Can users **share photos or logs externally** (via link or email)?

  * If yes, are shared links **tokenized** and **expire automatically**?
* Is there an option to **revoke shared links** or limit access duration?
* Can users **export** job data securely (e.g., password-protected ZIP or encrypted PDF)?

Would you like me to turn this into a **plugin audit checklist (Yes/No table)** so you can directly mark what‚Äôs implemented and what‚Äôs missing for each item?
