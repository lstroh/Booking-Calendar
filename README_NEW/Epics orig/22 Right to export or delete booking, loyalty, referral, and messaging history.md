Excellent — this is a **core GDPR requirement** and one that’s often overlooked in WordPress-based systems handling client and booking data.

Let’s break down:

> **GDPR & UK Act → Data Rights → Right to export or delete booking, loyalty, referral, and messaging history**
> Type: *Must-Have* | Effort: *12h* | Priority: *High*
> Dependencies: *Custom rewards engine* or *third-party loyalty API*

Below is a **complete verification checklist** so you can test whether the plugin supports full compliance for user data access, export, and deletion.

## ⚖️ GDPR & UK Act — Data Rights (Export & Deletion)

**Goal:** Allow users to **access, export, and delete** their personal data (bookings, loyalty/rewards, referrals, and messages) in a transparent, secure, and auditable way.

---

### **1. User Data Identification**

| #   | Check Item               | Description                                                                                                   | Implemented? |

| 1.2 | Linked to user account   | Each record is linked to a user ID or identifiable email, enabling lookup for export/deletion.                | ☐            |
| 1.3 | Anonymous guest handling | For guest bookings, system still allows lookup via email or booking reference.                                | ☐            |

Would you like me to **convert this into a CSV checklist** (like the others) so you can track plugin implementation status (Yes / Partial / No)?
