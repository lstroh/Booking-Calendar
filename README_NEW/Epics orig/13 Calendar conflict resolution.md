Perfect ‚Äî let‚Äôs break down **‚ÄúAdmin Experience ‚Üí Calendar & Availability ‚Üí Calendar conflict resolution rules‚Äù** into concrete, checkable items you can use to evaluate a plugin.

---

## üîç Breakdown Into Checkable Items

### 1. **Conflict Detection**

* [ ] Does the plugin **detect overlapping bookings** within its own system?
* [ ] Does it **detect conflicts with external calendar events** (Google/Outlook/Apple)?
* [ ] Are conflicts checked **in real time** during client booking?
* [ ] Does the plugin **block clients from booking overlapping slots** automatically?


### 2. **Conflict Resolution Rules (System Settings)**

* [ ] Can admins set **priority rules** (e.g., internal booking overrides external events, or vice versa)?
* [ ] Is there an option to allow **double-booking if required** (e.g., consultation + ongoing job)?
* [ ] Can buffer times (travel/setup) be treated as **non-overridable conflicts**?
* [ ] Can the plugin **restrict conflicts by resource** (e.g., tradesperson, tool, room)?



### 3. **Conflict Resolution Workflow (Admin Actions)**

* [ ] If a conflict occurs, does the plugin **warn the admin** with a clear error/notice?
* [ ] Can admins **manually override a conflict** to force-book a slot?
* [ ] Does the system **suggest alternative slots** to resolve the conflict automatically?
* [ ] Are conflicts **logged** for later review (audit trail)?



### 4. **User-Facing Behavior**

* [ ] Do clients see **only available slots** (conflicts hidden before selection)?
* [ ] If two clients try to book the same slot at once, does the plugin **handle race conditions** (first confirmed wins)?
* [ ] Are clients notified if their booking request **cannot be completed due to a conflict**?



### 5. **Integration with External Calendars**

* [ ] When an external event blocks time, does the plugin **prevent new bookings in that slot**?
* [ ] If an external event is deleted/changed, does availability **update automatically**?
* [ ] Can admins choose which **external calendars apply conflict rules** (e.g., ignore personal, use only business)?



### 6. **Configuration & Flexibility**

* [ ] Can different **staff/resources have independent conflict rules** (e.g., some allow double-booking, others not)?
* [ ] Is there support for **service-specific rules** (e.g., small jobs can overlap, large jobs cannot)?
* [ ] Can admins **customize the conflict resolution policy** without code changes?


‚úÖ **Success Criteria:**

* Conflicts are **detected both internally and against external calendars**.
* Admins can **define resolution rules** (priority, allow/deny overlaps, buffer enforcement).
* Clients are **protected from booking unavailable slots**.
* Admins retain the ability to **override or manually resolve conflicts**.
* External calendar sync is **respected in conflict rules**.

Would you like me to also create a **step-by-step testing scenario** (like a ‚Äúconflict simulation checklist‚Äù) so you can systematically verify how a plugin handles different types of conflicts?
