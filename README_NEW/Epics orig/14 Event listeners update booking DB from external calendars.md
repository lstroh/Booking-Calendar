Great ‚Äî let‚Äôs break down **‚ÄúAdmin Experience ‚Üí Calendar & Availability ‚Üí Event listeners update booking DB from external calendars‚Äù** into specific, checkable items you can use when evaluating a plugin.

---

## üîç Breakdown Into Checkable Items

### 1. **Calendar Event Sync Triggers**

* [ ] Does the plugin **listen for changes** in external calendars (Google, Outlook, Apple)?
* [ ] Are these triggers supported for:

  * [ ] **New event created** in external calendar ‚Üí booking DB updated.
  * [ ] **Event modified** (time/date/title/location) ‚Üí booking DB updated.
  * [ ] **Event deleted/cancelled** ‚Üí booking DB frees up the slot.



### 2. **Real-Time vs Scheduled Sync**

* [ ] Does the plugin use **push notifications/webhooks** (e.g., Google Calendar push notifications) for near real-time updates?
* [ ] If not real-time, does it support **scheduled polling** (e.g., every 5‚Äì15 minutes)?
* [ ] Can the **sync frequency be configured** by admin?



### 3. **Database Update Behavior**

* [ ] Do external calendar events **block availability** in the booking system?
* [ ] Are external changes written as **temporary holds/blocked slots** or as **full bookings** in the DB?
* [ ] Are **recurring events** from external calendars handled correctly in the booking DB?
* [ ] Does the system maintain **event IDs** for mapping (so updates/deletes are tracked reliably)?


### 4. **Conflict Handling**

* [ ] If a booking already exists in the DB and an external event overlaps, does the plugin **notify the admin**?
* [ ] Can admins set **priority rules** (e.g., booking overrides external event, or vice versa)?
* [ ] Are conflicts **logged** for audit?




### 5. **Admin Controls & Visibility**

* [ ] Is there a **sync log or activity history** showing external calendar updates applied to the DB?
* [ ] Can admins **manually trigger a resync** if needed?
* [ ] Can admins choose **which external calendars** feed into the booking DB (work vs personal)?



### 6. **Error Handling**

* [ ] If an external API call fails, does the system **retry automatically**?
* [ ] Are **errors surfaced to the admin** (dashboard alerts, email, log)?
* [ ] Does the plugin **fail gracefully** (e.g., does not delete valid bookings if an external update fails)?




### 7. **Compliance & Security**

* [ ] Does the plugin use **OAuth 2.0** for Google/Outlook integrations?
* [ ] Are external calendar tokens **stored securely**?
* [ ] Can admins **disconnect calendars** easily and remove all linked data?



‚úÖ **Success Criteria:**

* External calendar changes (create, update, delete) **update the booking database reliably**.
* Updates happen in **real-time or configurable short intervals**.
* System handles **conflicts, recurring events, and deletes correctly**.
* Admins have **full visibility (logs, controls, manual resync)**.
* OAuth + secure token handling ensures **safe integration with Google/Outlook/Apple**.

Do you also want me to prepare a **practical testing checklist** (step-by-step scenarios like ‚Äúcreate an event in Google Calendar ‚Üí check if it blocks booking slot in plugin‚Äù)? That way you could test a plugin hands-on.
