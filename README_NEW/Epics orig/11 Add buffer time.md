Perfect — let’s break **“Admin Experience → Booking Management → Add buffer time before/after bookings (travel/setup/admin)”** into a structured set of checkable items for plugin evaluation:

---

## 🔍 Breakdown Into Checkable Items

### 1. **Buffer Time Setup**

* [ ] Can I set a **default buffer time** for all services?
* [ ] Can I set **custom buffer times per service** (e.g., 15 min setup for Service A, 30 min for Service B)?
* [ ] Can I set **different buffer times for before and after a booking**?
* [ ] Can buffer times be **set per staff member/resource**?
* [ ] Can buffer times be **overridden manually for a single booking**?

### 2. **Scheduling & Availability**

* [ ] Does the buffer time **block the calendar correctly** (prevents overlapping bookings)?
* [ ] Does the client-facing booking form **show only available slots that respect buffer times**?
* [ ] Are buffer times **hidden from clients** (they only see bookable slots, not “gaps”)?
* [ ] Does changing buffer times **update availability dynamically**?


### 3. **Calendar & Dashboard**

* [ ] In the **admin calendar view**, are buffer times visible (e.g., shaded areas, blocks)?
* [ ] Do buffer times affect the **displayed duration of jobs** in the calendar?
* [ ] Are buffer times shown in **daily/weekly views** for staff?


### 4. **Integration & Notifications**

* [ ] Do buffer times carry over when syncing to **Google/Outlook/iCal**?
* [ ] Are staff **reminders/notifications** adjusted to include buffer time (so they know prep/travel time)?
* [ ] If reminders are sent to clients, is the **buffer excluded** (they should only see the job start time)?




### 5. **Flexibility & Edge Cases**

* [ ] Can buffer times be set to **zero or disabled** if not needed?
* [ ] Can buffer times be applied **only before OR only after**?
* [ ] Does the plugin handle **back-to-back bookings** correctly with buffer enforced?
* [ ] Are buffer times **respected across multiple staff/resources** (so two staff with different buffers don’t conflict)?



✅ **Success Criteria:**

* Buffer times are **configurable** (per service, staff, booking).
* Scheduling logic **enforces buffers** (no overlaps).
* Clients **only see valid slots** (buffers hidden from them).
* Buffer times sync with **calendars and staff reminders**.

Would you like me to now turn this into a **step-by-step test script** (e.g., “Step 1: Create service with 15 min buffer → Step 2: Try to book back-to-back → Step 3: Check client-facing form…”) so you can quickly test plugins one by one?
