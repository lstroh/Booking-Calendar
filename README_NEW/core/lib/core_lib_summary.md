File-by-File Summaries
core/lib/index.php
• Source MD file name: index.md
• Role (short sentence): This file is a standard security measure designed to prevent unauthorized directory listing on the web server.
• Key Technical Details (hooks, DB, etc.): It contains only the comment <?php // Silence is golden. ?> and has no executable PHP code, hooks, or database interaction.
• Features (Admin vs User): This file implements no functionality or features; its sole role is security hardening.
• Top Extension Opportunities: None; modifying this file is a significant deviation from WordPress best practices and creates maintenance/security risks.
• Suggested Next Files (from that MD): core/admin/wpbc-gutenberg.php, core/sync/wpbc-gcal.php, core/lib/wpdev-booking-widget.php.
core/lib/wpbc-ajax.php
• Source MD file name: wpbc-ajax.md, wpbc-ajax_v2.md
• Role (short sentence): This file serves as the main AJAX controller, registering and executing asynchronous booking management requests from both the admin dashboard and the frontend.
• Key Technical Details (hooks, DB, etc.): It uses add_action('wp_ajax_...') and add_action('wp_ajax_nopriv_...') to register endpoints. Security is enforced via nonce verification using wpbc_check_nonce_in_admin_panel() and WordPress core functions. It executes direct, prepared $wpdb queries for actions like updating booking status and deletion. It triggers custom business logic using make_bk_action and do_action.
• Features (Admin vs User): Admin: Enables dynamic, real-time UI updates for booking status (approve/trash/delete) and allows saving user interface preferences. User: Provides frontend AJAX endpoints supporting interactive features like cost calculation and timeline navigation.
• Top Extension Opportunities: Register new custom AJAX endpoints using the wpbc_ajax_action_list filter. Utilize action hooks (wpbc_booking_approved, wpbc_booking_delete) for side-effects like syncing with external systems.
• Suggested Next Files (from that MD): core/lib/wpdev-booking-class.php, core/lib/wpbc-calendar-legend.php, core/lib/wpbc-booking-new.php, core/wpbc-js-vars.php (Top Priority), js/client.js, core/wpbc-sql.php.
core/lib/wpbc-booking-new.php
• Source MD file name: wpbc-booking-new.md
• Role (short sentence): This file is an obsolete architectural artifact containing a legacy function for checking date intersections that is no longer used in the main booking creation workflow.
• Key Technical Details (hooks, DB, etc.): Contains the single, complex function wpbc_check_dates_intersections(), which manually manipulates date strings and relies on custom, unconventional time markers to check for booking conflicts. Developer comments explicitly label the function and file as deprecated.
• Features (Admin vs User): This file enables no active features of the current plugin version.
• Top Extension Opportunities: It is strongly recommended not to extend or interact with this file due to obsolete logic and the high risk of incorrectly bypassing modern capacity checking systems.
• Suggested Next Files (from that MD): core/any/api-emails.php, core/admin/wpbc-gutenberg.php, core/sync/wpbc-gcal.php.
core/lib/wpbc-calendar-legend.php
• Source MD file name: wpbc-calendar-legend.md
• Role (short sentence): This file manages the generation and display of the HTML legend that explains the status (e.g., approved, pending) of dates shown on the booking calendar.
• Key Technical Details (hooks, DB, etc.): Functionality relies on reading plugin options (e.g., booking_is_show_legend). The core rendering engine, wpbc_get_calendar_legend__content_html(), constructs HTML via rigid string concatenation using specific CSS classes. It handles the [legend_items] shortcode by hooking into the wpbc_replace_shortcodes_in_booking_form filter.
• Features (Admin vs User): Admin: The appearance and content are controlled via settings pages (consumer of options). User: Displays the visual calendar legend and supports the highly configurable [legend_items] shortcode for placement within forms.
• Top Extension Opportunities: Currently limited due to rigid HTML generation. An improvement opportunity is introducing a filter (e.g., wpbc_calendar_legend_items) to allow developers to safely add, remove, or modify legend items.
• Suggested Next Files (from that MD): core/admin/page-settings.php, core/wpbc-translation.php, core/form_parser.php.
core/lib/wpbc-cron.php
• Source MD file name: wpbc-cron.md
• Role (short sentence): This file implements a custom, non-native pseudo-cron system (WPBC_Cron class) used for scheduling and executing recurring tasks like Google Calendar synchronization.
• Key Technical Details (hooks, DB, etc.): It stores its task list in a serialized WordPress option (booking_cron). It executes tasks by hooking into the native init action (priority 9) on page loads, making it traffic-dependent. Tasks are executed using call_user_func_array('make_bk_action', ...).
• Features (Admin vs User): Admin: Provides helper functions (get_active_tasks_info()) to display the status of scheduled tasks on admin pages. User: Indirectly enables front-end accuracy by running background processes, such as updating availability via Google Calendar sync.
• Top Extension Opportunities: Developers can schedule custom tasks using the public add(), update(), and delete() methods of the global WPBC()->cron object, provided the tasks are hooked to custom actions (add_bk_action).
• Suggested Next Files (from that MD): core/sync/wpbc-gcal.php (Top Priority), core/admin/wpbc-gutenberg.php, core/admin/wpbc-toolbars.php.
core/lib/wpdev-booking-class.php
• Source MD file name: wpdev-booking-class.md
• Role (short sentence): This defines the main booking controller class, wpdev_booking, which registers all primary shortcodes and centralizes the logic for rendering the booking form and calendar.
• Key Technical Details (hooks, DB, etc.): Registers numerous shortcodes (e.g., [booking], [bookingform]) via the init hook. It uses plugin-specific hooks (wpdev_bk_add_calendar, wpdev_bk_get_form) to structure rendering. It reads plugin options extensively and uses the User API for auto-fill features, but it contains no direct database queries.
• Features (Admin vs User): Admin: Provides the underlying rendering logic used in admin settings and preview panels. User: Enables all core front-end features, including dynamic calendar display, booking forms, search functionality, and editing features via shortcodes.
• Top Extension Opportunities: Extend form and calendar output using rendering filters like wpdev_booking_form and wpdev_booking_calendar. Developers can register custom shortcodes in the wpbc_shortcodes_init() method.
• Suggested Next Files (from that MD): core/lib/wpbc-calendar-legend.php, core/lib/wpbc-booking-new.php, core/lib/wpbc-cron.php.
core/lib/wpdev-booking-widget.php
• Source MD file name: wpdev-booking-widget.md
• Role (short sentence): This file defines the BookingWidget class, a standard WordPress widget that allows administrators to easily place the booking form or availability calendar into theme-specific widget areas.
• Key Technical Details (hooks, DB, etc.): Extends WP_Widget and registers itself using the standard widgets_init hook. It uses a delegation pattern in its widget() method, calling the plugin's internal action hooks (make_bk_action('wpdevbk_add_form', ...)) to reuse the core rendering logic. It handles sanitation of settings in the update() method.
• Features (Admin vs User): Admin: Creates the settings interface for the widget within the Appearance > Widgets screen. User: Enables the placement and display of the booking form or calendar in sidebars, footers, or other widget-ready areas.
• Top Extension Opportunities: Since the widget reuses core rendering hooks, any code that filters or extends the main shortcode output will automatically apply to the widget. The widget title is also filterable via widget_title.
• Suggested Next Files (from that MD): core/admin/wpbc-gutenberg.php (Top Priority), core/sync/wpbc-gcal.php, core/admin/wpbc-toolbars.php.
Common Features and Patterns
The analysis reveals several consistent architectural patterns and technical practices across the core components:
• Custom Hook System: The plugin relies heavily on a custom internal action and filter mechanism (make_bk_action, do_action, add_bk_action) rather than solely using standard WordPress hooks for internal communication and logic execution. This system is utilized for booking events, form rendering, and even the pseudo-cron task execution.
• Layered Data Access: There is a clear separation between rendering logic (e.g., wpdev-booking-class.php performs no direct database queries) and control/processing logic. Critical, real-time actions performed by AJAX handlers (wpbc-ajax.php) bypass an abstraction layer and execute direct, prepared $wpdb queries for immediate status changes (UPDATE/DELETE).
• Security Focus: Robust security practices are standard for sensitive operations, including the universal application of nonce verification (often wrapped in custom checks like wpbc_check_nonce_in_admin_panel()) for all admin-facing AJAX endpoints. Furthermore, non-functional index.php files are used specifically for directory listing prevention.
• Architectural Legacy and Refactoring: The plugin displays a mixture of modern and legacy structures. While actively planning integration with modern APIs (like Gutenberg, suggested in next steps), older components persist, such as the obsolete date checking logic in core/lib/wpbc-booking-new.php and the reliance on a traffic-dependent, non-native pseudo-cron system.
• UI Centralization via Delegation: The complex rendering of the booking form and calendar is centralized within wpdev-booking-class.php and then exposed via internal action hooks (wpdevbk_add_form, wpdev_bk_add_calendar). External components, such as the widget (wpdev-booking-widget.php), use these hooks to delegate rendering, ensuring functional and visual consistency across shortcode and widget displays.
Extension Opportunities
The analyzed files reveal several key areas for safe and effective plugin extension:
1. AJAX Endpoint Registration: Use the wpbc_ajax_action_list filter provided in core/lib/wpbc-ajax.php to securely register custom AJAX actions and define corresponding handler functions within the plugin's existing request ecosystem.
2. Booking Workflow Side-Effects: Hook into existing post-event actions within the AJAX handlers, such as wpbc_booking_approved, wpbc_booking_trash, and wpbc_booking_delete, to trigger external logic (e.g., syncing with a CRM or external calendar service).
3. Scheduled Automation: Utilize the public methods (e.g., add(), update()) of the global WPBC()->cron object (defined in core/lib/wpbc-cron.php) to schedule custom automated tasks, ensuring the task logic is attached to a custom hook via add_bk_action.
4. UI and Rendering Modification: Extend the output of core rendering components using the filters wpdev_booking_form and wpdev_booking_calendar (defined in core/lib/wpdev-booking-class.php). Changes applied here automatically affect both shortcode and widget displays.
5. Custom Shortcodes: Register additional plugin shortcodes by hooking into or extending the logic within wpbc_shortcodes_init().
6. Calendar Legend Modification (Improvement): Although currently rigid, the introduction of a filter on the legend item array (e.g., wpbc_calendar_legend_items) is a suggested improvement that would allow developers to add new custom legend statuses without modifying core files.
