The provided sources offer an architectural analysis of several files within a Booking Calendar plugin, focusing on security, administrative UI, and update processes. Since the sources do not describe external, real-world events but rather the structure and function of software components, the timeline will chart the developmental progression and implementation of these features, and the cast of characters will represent the abstract software entities (classes and functions) responsible for these actions.

Detailed Timeline of Implemented Features
Date/Version ImpliedEvent/Feature DescriptionKey Components InvolvedPre-Version 10.13Initial Setup of Directory Securityindex.phpA standard security measure is implemented in the /core/class/ directory to prevent directory browsing. This file (index.php) contains only the comment <?php // Silence is golden. ?> to produce a blank page, thus hiding sensitive class files.Version 10.13 ImplementationDevelopment of Modular "What's New" Contentwelcome_current.php, WPBC_Welcome (in wpbc-class-welcome.php)A specific function (wpbc_welcome_section_10_13) is created within welcome_current.php to define and render the release notes for version 10.13 using a consistent, collapsible layout.Version 10.14 ImplementationFeature Expansion of "What's New" Contentwelcome_current.php, WPBC_WelcomeA new function (wpbc_welcome_section_10_14) is added to house the HTML and text for the release notes specific to version 10.14, demonstrating an ongoing modular update process.Activation/Update LogicImplementation of Post-Update RedirectWPBC_WelcomeThe plugin develops and implements the core logic to automatically redirect administrators to the "What's New" page immediately following an update or activation, ensuring only one redirect per version. This logic uses a WordPress transient (_booking_activation_redirect) and a database option (booking_activation_redirect_for_version).UI ImplementationCreation of Hidden Admin Welcome PageWPBC_WelcomeThe "What's New" page (index.php?page=wpbc-about) is registered using add_dashboard_page() but immediately hidden from the menu using remove_submenu_page(), making it accessible only via the automated redirect.Support Feature ImplementedCreation of Persistent Downgrade Warning SystemWPBC_NoticesThe WPBC_Notices class is developed to manage and display persistent, dismissible admin warnings. The first critical message implemented is the updated_paid_to_free notice, which warns administrators if a paid version was potentially downgraded to the free version.System IntegrationHooking Notices into Admin UIWPBC_NoticesThe notice system is integrated using custom plugin hooks (wpbc_hook_*_page_header) to ensure warnings appear consistently at the top of main plugin pages (Bookings, Settings, etc.), rather than on every WordPress admin page.Internationalization (i18n) FeatureDevelopment of Silent Translation UpgraderWPBC_Upgrader_Translation_SkinA specialized class is created that extends the core WordPress upgrader skin. This class overrides standard UI output, providing minimal, customized feedback ("Translation updated successfully.") while suppressing the standard admin page header and footer.Ongoing PriorityFocus on Core Functionality Analysis(Files under Recommendation)After analyzing admin UI and security components, the development/analysis focus shifts to critical core features: Google Calendar synchronization (wpbc-gcal.php), the visual booking timeline (flex-timeline.php), and resource management (page-resource-free.php).Cast of Characters (Software Entities)
The characters in this context are the central classes and files that define the plugin's behavior and features.

CharacterTypeBrief BioWPBC_WelcomePHP ClassThe central administrator UI controller responsible for managing the post-update experience. It handles the logic for automatically redirecting users to the "What's New" page after an update, registering the hidden admin page, and rendering the modular content for various versions.welcome_current.phpPHP View FileThe content provider for the "What's New" page. It contains a series of procedural functions (e.g., wpbc_welcome_section_10_14) that house the static HTML and release notes for specific plugin versions, which are then rendered by the WPBC_Welcome class.WPBC_NoticesPHP ClassThe administrator communication system. This class manages persistent, dismissible warnings that appear on specific plugin pages. Its primary function is to alert administrators to critical issues, such as a potential downgrade from a paid to a free version.WPBC_Upgrader_Translation_SkinPHP ClassA specialized UI component that extends the core WordPress WP_Upgrader_Skin. Its purpose is to facilitate silent or headless updates for translation files, providing customized, minimal success/error messages without displaying the full WordPress admin page layout.index.phpSecurity FileA crucial, non-functional security measure within the /core/class/ directory. Its sole purpose is to serve a blank page (<?php // Silence is golden. ?>) to prevent unauthorized directory listing of sensitive class files.wpbc_is_dismissed()External Helper FunctionA function (defined elsewhere) used by WPBC_Notices to check if the current user has permanently dismissed a specific persistent admin warning, managing user meta data for notice visibility.wpbc_is_updated_paid_to_free()External Helper FunctionA function (defined elsewhere) used by WPBC_Notices to check the plugin's status and trigger the critical warning if a paid version is detected to have been overwritten by a free version.core/sync/wpbc-gcal.phpFeature File (Priority)A core component identified as a top priority for analysis. It is responsible for handling complex, authenticated interactions with the Google Calendar API for synchronization, a major plugin feature.core/timeline/flex-timeline.phpFeature File (Priority)A core administrative UI component identified for future analysis. It is responsible for querying and rendering booking data in a visual timeline format for administrators.
