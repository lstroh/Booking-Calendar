# File Analysis: `core/wpbc-emails.php`

This document provides a detailed analysis of the `core/wpbc-emails.php` file from the Booking Calendar plugin repository.

## High-Level Overview

This file is the central hub for all email-related functionality in the plugin. It contains a suite of functions for validating, formatting, and preparing emails for sending. While it does not define the core email-sending class itself, it provides crucial helper functions and hooks into the plugin's Email API to modify and enhance the emails before they are sent.

Its key responsibilities include:
-   Sanitizing and formatting email addresses.
-   Dynamically setting the `Reply-To` header on admin notifications for easy responses.
-   Integrating with the `wpbc_lang` system to ensure email templates are translated.
-   Providing the help text and list of available shortcodes for the email template editor in the admin panel.
-   Implementing a central kill-switch to prevent emails from being sent in demo or playground environments.

## Detailed Explanation

This file contains a mix of standalone utility functions and functions that hook into the plugin's core Email API (which is likely defined in `core/any/api-emails.php`).

-   **`wpbc_validate_emails( $emails )`**: A robust utility for cleaning and formatting a string or array of email addresses. It can correctly parse `"Name <email@example.com>"` formats and ensures all email addresses are properly sanitized using `sanitize_email`.

-   **`wpbc_wp_mail( $mail_recipient, $mail_subject, $mail_body, $mail_headers )`**: This is a wrapper for the standard WordPress `wp_mail()` function. Its primary purpose is to instantiate a temporary class (`wpbc_email_return_path`) that hooks into `phpmailer_init` to fix the `Sender` header. This is a common technique to improve email deliverability. It also uses the `wpbc_email_api_is_allow_send` filter to provide a central point to block email sending.

-   **`wpbc_get_email_help_shortcodes()`**: This function generates the HTML for the help section on the email settings pages. It dynamically builds a list of all available shortcodes (e.g., `[booking_id]`, `[dates]`, `[resource_title]`, `[moderatelink]`) that can be used in email templates. It is version-aware, showing different shortcodes depending on which version of the plugin (Personal, Business, etc.) is active.

## Features Enabled

### Admin Menu

-   This file provides the **content for the help sections** on the email template editing pages (e.g., **Settings > Emails**). It generates the list of available shortcodes that an administrator can use to customize emails.
-   It is responsible for the `Reply-To` functionality that makes managing bookings via email much easier for site admins.

### User-Facing

-   This file is responsible for **sending all transactional emails** to both the site administrator and the customer after a booking is made, approved, or modified.
-   It ensures that these emails are correctly formatted, translated, and delivered reliably.

## Extension Opportunities

While this file primarily contains internal logic, it reveals several extension points in the underlying Email API that a developer could use.

-   **Modify Email Headers**: A developer could add their own function to the `wpbc_email_api_get_headers_after` filter with a higher priority (e.g., 20) to override the default `Reply-To` logic or to add other custom headers like `X-CRM-ID`.
    ```php
    function my_custom_email_headers( $headers, $email_id, $fields, $replaces, $params ) {
        if ( 'new_admin' == $email_id ) {
            $headers .= 'X-Custom-Header: MyValue' . "\r\n";
        }
        return $headers;
    }
    add_filter( 'wpbc_email_api_get_headers_after', 'my_custom_email_headers', 20, 5 );
    ```
-   **Conditionally Block Emails**: The `wpbc_email_api_is_allow_send` filter can be used to implement custom logic for preventing certain emails from being sent. For example, one could block emails to specific domains or for bookings under a certain cost.

## Next File Recommendations

This file's code clearly indicates that it is a companion to a more central Email API.

1.  **`core/any/api-emails.php`**: **Top Priority.** The comments and filter names in `wpbc-emails.php` strongly suggest this is the file containing the core Email API class and logic. Analyzing it is essential to understanding how email templates are stored, parsed, and sent.
2.  **`core/any/class-admin-menu.php`**: This file remains a high-priority, un-analyzed file that is key to understanding the overall structure of the admin panel where the email settings pages are located.
3.  **`core/lib/wpbc-booking-new.php`**: This file likely contains the logic for creating bookings manually from the admin panel. It would be the place that triggers the sending of these emails after a booking is manually created.
