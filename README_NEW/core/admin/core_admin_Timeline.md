The provided sources detail the architectural breakdown of a WordPress plugin, focusing on its administrative settings, email notification system, synchronization capabilities (ICS and Google Calendar), and UI components (toolbars, dashboard, and Gutenberg integration).

Detailed Timeline of Main Events
The timeline focuses on the development and implementation flow of the plugin, from core setup to advanced features.

Time Period / EventProcess / File InvolvedSummary of EventLegacy Upgradewpbc_import6_... functions (in all email files)The plugin's initial phase involves ensuring backward compatibility by importing old email settings (e.g., booking_email_deny_content) into the new Email API structure. This process is documented across all specific email template files.Plugin Core Activationwpdev-booking.php (Assumed) & core/wpbc-activation.phpThe plugin is installed and activated. This stage is where the database tables (wp_booking, wp_bookingdates) are created, although the explicit SQL is not provided in the sources.Core Settings Foundationcore/any/class-admin-settings-api.php, core/admin/page-settings.phpThe core settings framework (WPBC_Settings_API and WPBC_Page_SettingsGeneral) is established. This defines the structure for all configuration pages and handles access control (e.g., redirecting non-Super Admins in Multisite).General Settings Configurationcore/admin/api-settings.phpThe comprehensive list of general settings (Calendar, Availability, Confirmation) is defined within the WPBC_Settings_API_General class. Client-side logic (enqueue_js) is implemented for dynamic UI interactivity.Admin UI Constructioncore/admin/wpbc-toolbars.php, core/any/admin-bs-ui.phpReusable UI components and complex toolbars (for "Bookings," "Timeline," and "Add New Booking") are defined, including personalized view settings saved via AJAX.New Booking Submission (Workflow Initiation)wpbc_send_email_new_admin(), wpbc_send_email_new_visitor()A user submits a new booking. Two immediate notifications are generated and sent: one to the visitor (WPBC_Emails_API_NewVisitor) and one to the administrator (WPBC_Emails_API_NewAdmin), using tailored shortcodes.Manual Booking Creationcore/admin/page-new.phpAn administrator manually adds a booking via the "Bookings > Add New" page, reusing the front-end form rendering engine (wpdevbk_add_form).Booking Status Change (Approval)core/admin/page-email-approved.php, wpbc_send_email_approved()An administrator approves a booking, triggering the sending of the "Approved" confirmation email to the visitor.Booking Status Change (Pending/Deny)core/admin/page-email-deny.php, wpbc_send_email_deny()An administrator sets a booking status to pending, triggering the sending of the "Pending" email, often using the file's historical "Deny" context.Booking Status Change (Deletion/Trash)core/admin/page-email-deleted.php, core/admin/page-email-trash.phpAn administrator deletes or trashes a booking. This triggers the corresponding "Deleted" or "Trash / Reject" email to the visitor, including a reason if provided.ICS Synchronization Setupcore/admin/page-ics-general.phpAn administrator configures global sync options, including event field mapping (e.g., mapping a form field to the event title) and setting the synchronization timezone.ICS Export Configurationcore/admin/page-ics-export.phpThe UI for generating .ics export feed URLs is provided. For premium users, this functionality is delegated to the "Booking Manager" companion plugin.ICS Import Initiationcore/admin/page-ics-import.phpAn administrator initiates an import from an external .ics URL, triggering an AJAX request that delegates the core parsing logic via the wpbm_ics_import_start hook (requiring "Booking Manager").Google Calendar Import Setupcore/admin/page-import-gcal.phpAn administrator configures the Google API Key, activation, and import frequency. The system then schedules a WordPress cron job (wpbc_import_gcal) to automate the import via the wpbc_silent_import_all_events action.Admin Data Visualization (Timeline)core/admin/page-timeline.php, WPBC_TimelineFlex (external)An administrator views the "Timeline View," where the page controller sets up filters and delegates the data query and rendering to the specialized WPBC_TimelineFlex class.Admin Data Retrievalcore/admin/wpbc-sql.phpThe system dynamically constructs complex, sanitized SQL queries (using wpbc_get_sql_for_booking_listing) to filter and retrieve booking data for the Booking Listing and Timeline pages based on admin selections.Dashboard Statisticscore/admin/wpbc-dashboard.phpThe plugin queries the database to calculate real-time booking statistics (pending, approved, today's check-ins) and displays them in a dedicated WordPress Dashboard widget.Modern WP Integrationcore/admin/wpbc-gutenberg.phpThe "Booking" block (booking/booking) is registered in WordPress, linking the PHP backend with the React-based client-side implementation (js/wpbc-gutenberg.js) for use in the Block Editor.System Troubleshootingcore/admin/wpbc-settings-functions.phpA hidden System Info panel is accessed via a URL parameter, allowing developers or support staff to perform advanced maintenance tasks (e.g., resetting forms, viewing server info).Cast of Characters
This list details the principal classes and files, which act as the main "characters" in the plugin's architecture, along with the companion plugins required for advanced features.

CharacterRole / File NameBrief BioWPBC_Settings_API_Generalcore/admin/api-settings.phpThe blueprint designer.
