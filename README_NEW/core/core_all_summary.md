| **Source MD file name** | page-ics-export.php-analysis.md |
| **Role (short sentence)** | Provides the administrative UI for generating a public .ics feed URL to export bookings to external calendars. |
| **Key Technical Details** | Delegates advanced export features to the **"Booking Manager"** companion plugin; checks for the presence and minimum version (2.1) of the "Booking Manager" plugin before full functionality is rendered. |
| **Features (Admin vs User)** | **Admin:** Provides the UI to configure and generate the .ics export URL. **User:** None directly; the generated feed URL is consumed by external calendars. |
| **Top Extension Opportunities** | The primary logic is delegated to a companion plugin, limiting safe core extension points within this file itself. |
| **Suggested Next Files (from that MD)** | None explicitly listed in sources. |

### core/admin/page-ics-general.php
<a id="core/admin/page-ics-general.php"></a>
| Field | Summary |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Source MD file name** | page-ics-general.php-analysis.md |
| **Role (short sentence)** | Manages the global settings for synchronization features, including timezone and the critical mapping of booking form fields to iCalendar event properties. |
| **Key Technical Details** | Provides a timezone picker; manages **"pseudo-options"** (form field mapping dropdowns) that are combined and saved as a single serialized option (`booking_gcal_events_form_fields`) using filters (`wpbc_fields_before_saving_to_db__general_sync`). |
| **Features (Admin vs User)** | **Admin:** Configures general synchronization settings under Booking > Settings > Sync; allows dynamic mapping of form fields (e.g., `[text your-name]`) to iCalendar properties (Title, Description, Location). **User:** None directly. |
| **Top Extension Opportunities** | Hook into the filters that manage saving the pseudo-fields (`wpbc_fields_before_saving_to_db__general_sync`) if custom mapping logic is required. |
| **Suggested Next Files (from that MD)** | None explicitly listed in sources. |

### core/admin/page-ics-import.php

| Field | Summary |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Source MD file name** | page-ics-import.php-analysis.md |
| **Role (short sentence)** | Provides the UI for importing events from external .ics URLs (e.g., Airbnb) and delegates the core import process logic to a companion plugin. |
| **Key Technical Details** | The entire import process is delegated via the crucial hook **`do_action( 'wpbm_ics_import_start', ... )`**, which requires the **"Booking Manager"** companion plugin (v2.1+); displays an error message if the dependency is missing or outdated. |
| **Features (Admin vs User)** | **Admin:** Provides the UI to initiate an import from an external .ics URL. **User:** None directly. |
| **Top Extension Opportunities** | Hook into the **`wpbm_ics_import_start`** action hook if extending the parsing logic within the companion plugin's environment. |
| **Suggested Next Files (from that MD)** | None explicitly listed in sources. |

### core/admin/page-import-gcal.php
<a id="core/admin/page-import-gcal.php"></a>
| Field | Summary |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Source MD file name** | page-import-gcal-analysis.md |
| **Role (short sentence)** | This administrative controller manages the configuration and automated scheduling of the complex Google Calendar import feature. |
| **Key Technical Details** | Allows configuration of the Google API Key and import parameters (max events, date offsets); uses the `wpbc_fields_after_saving_to_db__import_gcal()` function to manage the recurring import schedule; calls `WPBC()->cron->update()` to schedule the **`wpbc_silent_import_all_events`** action for execution by the plugin's custom cron system. |
| **Features (Admin vs User)** | **Admin:** Manages Google API connection settings and defines the automated import frequency/schedule. **User:** None directly. |
| **Top Extension Opportunities** | The `wpbc_silent_import_all_events` action provides a direct hook for monitoring or modifying the import process run by the custom cron scheduler. |
| **Suggested Next Files (from that MD)** | None explicitly listed in sources. |

### core/admin/page-new.php
<a id="core/admin/page-new.php"></a>
| Field | Summary |

| Field | Summary |
| :--- | :--- |

| **Role (short sentence)** | This file defines the **WPBC_Page_SettingsGeneral** class, which is the chief architect of the main General Settings configuration screen. |
| **Key Technical Details** | Builds the entire tabbed, meta-box UI structure for the General Settings page; manages saving the defined options to the database; contains a **"Hardcoded Navigation" array** for tabs, noted as a major limitation for update-safe extension. |
| **Features (Admin vs User)** | **Admin:** Renders the main Booking > Settings screen and manages the overall UI structure. **User:** None directly. |
| **Top Extension Opportunities** | Use standard action hooks (e.g., `wpbc_hook_settings_page_header`) for adding custom content to the admin page header. |
| **Suggested Next Files (from that MD)** | None explicitly listed in sources. |

### core/admin/page-timeline.php
<a id="core/admin/page-timeline.php"></a>
| Field | Summary |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Source MD file name** | page-timeline-analysis.md |
| **Role (short sentence)** | Acts as the page controller for the administrative Timeline View, setting up the UI scaffolding but delegating all core rendering and data logic. |
| **Key Technical Details** | Defines the **WPBC_Page_CalendarOverview** class; its role is limited to setting up the toolbar, filters, and timezone handling; delegates complex data fetching and HTML generation to the separate **WPBC_TimelineFlex** class. |
| **Features (Admin vs User)** | **Admin:** Renders the administrative interface for visualizing bookings chronologically. **User:** None directly. |
| **Top Extension Opportunities** | The most effective extension points lie in the data layer (core/admin/wpbc-sql.php) that feeds data to the delegated **WPBC_TimelineFlex** class. |
| **Suggested Next Files (from that MD)** | None explicitly listed in sources. |

### core/admin/wpbc-dashboard.php
<a id="core/admin/wpbc-dashboard.php"></a>
| Field | Summary |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Source MD file name** | wpbc-dashboard-analysis.md |
| **Role (short sentence)** | Creates and manages the plugin's dedicated dashboard widget, providing administrators with at-a-glance statistics. |
| **Key Technical Details** | Contains `wpbc_dashboard_widget_show()`; queries the database via `wpbc_db_dashboard_get_bookings_count_arr()` to retrieve counts for new, pending, approved, and today's check-ins; manipulates the global `$wp_meta_boxes` array to move the widget to the top of the dashboard. |
| **Features (Admin vs User)** | **Admin:** Displays real-time booking statistics prominently on the WordPress Dashboard. **User:** None directly. |
| **Top Extension Opportunities** | Developers can filter the booking count array returned by `wpbc_db_dashboard_get_bookings_count_arr()` to modify the displayed statistics. |
| **Suggested Next Files (from that MD)** | None explicitly listed in sources. |

### core/admin/wpbc-gutenberg.php
<a id="core/admin/wpbc-gutenberg.php"></a>
| Field | Summary |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Source MD file name** | wpbc-gutenberg-analysis.md |
| **Role (short sentence)** | This file is the PHP bridge for integrating the plugin with the modern WordPress Block Editor (Gutenberg). |
| **Key Technical Details** | Registers the custom block named **`booking/booking`** using `register_block_type()`; enqueues necessary JavaScript (`js/wpbc-gutenberg.js`) which uses React (`wp-element`) as a dependency; the file defines no `render_callback`, meaning implementation is delegated entirely to the client-side JavaScript. |
| **Features (Admin vs User)** | **Admin:** Registers the "Booking" block for use within the block editor, likely acting as a visual wrapper for configuring the traditional `[booking]` shortcode. **User:** None directly. |
| **Top Extension Opportunities** | Extension focuses on the client-side JavaScript (`js/wpbc-gutenberg.js`) or adding custom block attributes via the PHP registration. |
| **Suggested Next Files (from that MD)** | None explicitly listed in sources. |

### core/admin/wpbc-settings-functions.php
<a id="core/admin/wpbc-settings-functions.php"></a>

### core/any/activation.php
<a id="core/any/activation.php"></a>
| Field | Summary |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Source MD file name** | activation.php-analysis.md |
| **Role (short sentence)** | This file manages the plugin's lifecycle (activation, deactivation, and updates) and enhances the admin user experience on the WordPress Plugins page. |
| **Key Technical Details** | Defines the abstract class **WPBC_Install**; orchestrates critical tasks like setting the plugin version (`booking_version_num`); sets a transient (`_booking_activation_redirect`) to guide the admin to a setup wizard after activation; deactivation logic respects the user option `booking_is_delete_if_deactive`. |
| **Features (Admin vs User)** | **Admin:** Adds action links ("Settings," "Start Setup Wizard") and version meta information to the plugins.php page. **User:** Has no direct impact on the user-facing side of the website. |
| **Top Extension Opportunities** | Use the custom actions **`make_bk_action( 'wpbc_activation' )`** for idempotent setup tasks and **`make_bk_action( 'wpbc_deactivation' )`** for conditional cleanup. |

### core/any/api-emails.php
<a id="core/any/api-emails.php"></a>
| Field | Summary |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Source MD file name** | api-emails.md |
| **Role (short sentence)** | Defines the abstract API (**WPBC_Emails_API**) which acts as the core engine for the entire email notification system, standardizing template creation, content storage, and sending logic. |
| **Key Technical Details** | The abstract class extends **WPBC_Settings_API**; child classes must implement `init_settings_fields()` to define template structure; includes a shortcode replacement engine (`replace_shortcodes()`); uses the `phpmailer_init` hook to set the Sender property for deliverability; the filter **`wpbc_email_api_is_allow_send`** acts as a global "kill switch". |
| **Features (Admin vs User)** | **Admin:** Provides the framework for creating the customizable settings pages found under Booking > Settings > Emails. **User:** Sends all transactional emails (confirmations, notifications) to both site visitors and administrators. |
| **Top Extension Opportunities** | Create a new class extending **WPBC_Emails_API** to define a custom email template. Use the filter **`wpbc_email_api_is_allow_send`** to conditionally prevent emails from being sent. |

<a id="core/any/class-admin-menu.php"></a>
| Field | Summary |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Source MD file name** | class-admin-menu.md, class-admin-menu_ver2.md |
| **Role (short sentence)** | Defines the object-oriented factory class (**WPBC_Admin_Menus**) that standardizes the process of registering all top-level and submenu pages in the WordPress admin interface. |
| **Key Technical Details** | Implements the **content delegation pattern**: the `content()` method fires the custom action **`do_action('wpbc_page_structure_show', $menu_tag)`** instead of rendering content directly; ensures efficient asset loading by using page-specific WordPress hooks (e.g., `admin_print_styles-{page hook}`); simplifies permissions by mapping user roles to capabilities. |
| **Features (Admin vs User)** | **Admin:** The foundational engine for the entire admin menu structure (e.g., "Bookings," "Settings"). **User:** Exclusively for the backend interface. |
| **Top Extension Opportunities** | Use delegation hooks like **`wpbc_page_structure_show`** to inject content or **`wpbc_define_nav_tabs`** to add navigation tabs to existing pages. |

<a id="core/any/class-admin-settings-api.php"></a>
| Field | Summary |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Source MD file name** | class-admin-settings-api.md |
| **Role (short sentence)** | Abstract class (**WPBC_Settings_API**) providing a custom, object-oriented framework for defining, displaying, validating, and saving all configuration settings for the plugin, replacing the native WordPress Settings API. |
| **Key Technical Details** | Requires child classes to implement the abstract method **`init_settings_fields()`** to define the settings array; validation is handled by `validate_post()` using type-specific validation methods; supports flexible database saving strategies (single serialized array or individual options). |
| **Features (Admin vs User)** | **Admin:** Provides the foundational API that enables other components (like General Settings) to rapidly build complex, consistent settings interfaces. **User:** No direct user-facing features. |
| **Top Extension Opportunities** | Create a new class that extends **WPBC_Settings_API** and implements `init_settings_fields()` to create a new settings group. The **`wpbc_fields_after_saving_to_db`** filter allows triggering side effects after settings are saved. |

### core/any/class-css-js.php
<a id="core/any/class-css-js.php"></a>
| Field | Summary |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Source MD file name** | class-css-js.php-analysis.md |
| **Role (short sentence)** | Abstract base class (**WPBC_JS_CSS**) that provides a standardized, performance-oriented framework for registering and conditionally loading all CSS and JavaScript assets. |
| **Key Technical Details** | Implements a **two-phase asset loading system** (Registration vs. Enqueuing); Registration uses standard WordPress hooks (e.g., `admin_enqueue_scripts`), but Enqueuing uses custom plugin actions (e.g., **`wpbc_load_js_on_admin_page`**) for conditional, page-specific loading; the filter `wpbc_is_load_script_on_this_page` controls the loading feature. |
| **Features (Admin vs User)** | **Admin:** Enables the loading of necessary CSS and JavaScript only on specific plugin pages, improving backend performance. **User:** Provides the framework for loading required CSS/JS for front-end booking forms. |
| **Top Extension Opportunities** | Use the custom actions **`wpbc_enqueue_style`** and **`wpbc_enqueue_script`** to safely add custom assets after the core assets have loaded. The filter `wpbc_is_load_script_on_this_page` can be used to programmatically prevent asset loading. |

| Field | Summary |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Source MD file name** | wpbc-class-welcome.md |
| **Role (short sentence)** | Defines the **WPBC_Welcome** class, responsible for managing the post-update redirect behavior and rendering the administrative "What's New" page. |
| **Key Technical Details** | Hooked into `admin_init`; manages a WordPress transient (`_booking_activation_redirect`) and a database option to ensure the redirect only happens once per new version; registers the page as a **hidden admin page** using `add_dashboard_page()` followed immediately by `remove_submenu_page()`. |
| **Features (Admin vs User)** | **Admin:** Implements the automatic redirect mechanism after plugin activation/update and creates the hidden admin page at `index.php?page=wpbc-about`. **User:** Has no user-facing features. |
| **Top Extension Opportunities** | The class is not designed for easy extension; the only straightforward modification is disabling the post-update redirect by removing the action hook associated with the `welcome()` method. |

### core/form_parser.php
<a id="core/form_parser.php"></a>
| Field | Summary |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Source MD file name** | form_parser.md |
| **Role (short sentence)** | Dedicated utility for parsing the plugin's custom text-based form configuration (shortcode-like syntax) into a structured PHP array. |
| **Key Technical Details** | The main engine is **`wpbc_parse_form()`**; uses complex **regular expressions (`preg_match_all`)** to deconstruct form-field shortcodes (e.g., `text*`, `select`); **`wpbc_parse_form_shortcode_values()`** processes field values, supporting the `@@` syntax for display title/submission value separation. It does not directly interact with the database. |
| **Features (Admin vs User)** | **Admin:** It is the engine that interprets and validates the form syntax used in the "Form" editor within plugin settings. **User:** It is a prerequisite for rendering any booking form HTML on the front-end. |
| **Top Extension Opportunities** | The list of supported shortcode types is hardcoded into the regex, creating a significant limitation. A suggested improvement is to make the shortcode types filterable (e.g., via a `wpbc_form_parser_shortcode_types` filter). |

| **Source MD file name** | wpbc-calendar-legend.md |
| **Role (short sentence)** | This file manages the generation and display of the HTML legend that explains the status (e.g., available, pending, approved) of dates shown on the booking calendar. |
| **Key Technical Details** | Handles the **`[legend_items]` shortcode** by hooking into the `wpbc_replace_shortcodes_in_booking_form` filter; functionality relies on reading plugin options (e.g., `booking_is_show_legend`); the HTML is built via rigid string concatenation. |
| **Features (Admin vs User)** | **Admin:** Appearance and content are controlled via admin settings. **User:** Displays the visual calendar legend and supports the configurable `[legend_items]` shortcode. |
| **Top Extension Opportunities** | **Limited** due to rigid HTML generation. A suggested improvement is introducing a filter (e.g., `wpbc_calendar_legend_items`) to safely add, remove, or modify legend items. |

## Common Features and Patterns

The analysis of numerous core files reveals several defining architectural features and patterns across theinit_settings_fields()` method.
    *   **Cron System:** A **custom pseudo-cron system (WPBC_Cron)** bypasses WP-Cron, storing tasks in the `booking_cron` option and relying on the high-priority WordPress `init` action (triggered by site traffic) to check and execute scheduled tasks (e.g., Google Calendar sync).

2.  **Delegation and Separation of Concerns (MVC Pattern):** There is a rigorous separation between the user interface (Controller) and the business/data logic (Engine/API).
    *   **Admin UI Delegation:** Files that define the visual administrative page structure (e.g., `core/admin/page-timeline.php`) immediately fire custom hooks (`wpbc_page_structure_show`) to delegate content rendering to specialized classes (like **WPBC_TimelineFlex**).
    *   **UI Component Reuse:** Front-end components (89, 197, 201, 214, 228]. This system provides the internal plumbing for modularity and allows developers to intercept settings retrieval via filters like `wpdev_bk_get_option`.

4.  **Robust Asset Management and Performance:** Asset loading is managed defensively to ensure performance and prevent conflicts.
    *   **Conditional Loading:** The **WPBC_JS_CSS** framework uses a two-phase system (registering globally, then conditionally enqueuing via custom hooks) to load assets only on specific pages.
    *   **Conflict Prevention:** Dedicated methods (`remove_conflicts()`) explicitly `wp_dequeue_style` or `wp_deregister_script` known conflicting third-party assets.
    *   **Script Integrity:** The JavaScript controller defensively removes `async` and `defer` attributes from critical script tags (including jQuery) to guarantee 127, 189, 219, 228].
    *   **AJAX Security:** All sensitive administrative AJAX actions (`core/lib/wpbc-ajax.php`) mandate strict **nonce verification** via functions like `wpbc_check_nonce_in_admin_panel()` to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
    *   **Query Handling:** The primary data retrieval engine (`core/admin/wpbc-sql.php`) includes `wpbc_check_request_paramters()` for sanitizing all incoming request parameters to prevent SQL injection.

## Extension Opportunities

The plugin offers several intentional extension points, largely focused on leveraging the custom internal hook system and filtering data flow, as direct file modification is highly discouraged, especially for core PHP logic, minified assets, and files acting as loaders or security placeholders.

| Area of Extension | Extension Mechanism | Context and Source Files |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Booking Lifecycle Events** |227]. |
| **Settings and Data Flow** | Filter configuration retrieval. | Use the powerful custom filter **`add_bk_filter('wpdev_bk_get_option', ...)`** (defined in `core/wpbc-core.php`) to intercept and modify plugin settings before they are retrieved by core components (e.g., overriding GCal settings during a cron run). |
| **Programmatic Booking** | Use the high-level Developer API. | Call **`wpbc_api_booking_add_new()`** | Utilize the custom cron object. | Use the public `add()`, `update()`, and `delete()` methods of the global **`WPBC()->cron` object** (defined in `core/lib/wpbc-cron.php`) to schedule custom, recurring automated tasks. |
| **Admin UI Content Injection** | Hook into content delegation. | Use the custom action **`wpbc_page_structure_show`** (fired by `core/any/class-admin-menu.php`) to safely inject content onto custom admin pages. |
| **Calendar/Form Rendering** | Filter the rendering output. | Use filters like **`wpdev_booking_form`** and **`wpdev_booking_calendar`** (in `core/lib/wpdev-booking-class.php`) to modify form or calendar HTML, affecting both shortcode and widget displays uniformly. |
| **Custom Assets & Styling** | Custom hooks and CSS variables. | Use the action hooks **`wpbc_enqueue_`, `core/any/api-emails.php`, `core/admin/page-timeline.php`) are explicitly excluded based on the implied content of `completed_files.txt`.
