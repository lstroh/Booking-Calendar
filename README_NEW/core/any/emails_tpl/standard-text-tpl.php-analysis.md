# File Analysis: `core/any/emails_tpl/standard-text-tpl.php`

## High-Level Overview

This file is a PHP template that generates a structured, "styled" plain-text email body. It is the direct counterpart to the `standard-html-tpl.php` file and is intended to be used as the `text/plain` part of a multipart email when the "Standard" template is selected.

Its purpose is to provide a more readable and organized plain-text email by adding simple text-based separators and a title treatment for the header. While it contains no HTML, it uses characters like `=` and `-` to create a visual hierarchy, improving the user experience for those who view emails in plain text.

Architecturally, it is a simple view component called by the main email engine (`WPBC_Emails_API`) to render the plain-text content.

## Detailed Explanation

The file's logic is contained within a single function:

-   **`wpbc_email_template_standard_text( $fields_values )`**: This function constructs the styled plain-text email body.
    -   It accepts an array, `$fields_values`, which contains the `header_content`, `content`, and `footer_content`.
    -   It uses an output buffer (`ob_start()` and `ob_get_clean()`) to capture its output into a string.
    -   **Text-Based Styling**: It creates a visual structure by:
        -   Wrapping the header content with `= ... =` to make it look like a title.
        -   Adding a separator line of hyphens (`---`) between the header, main content, and footer.

    ```php
    // The core styling logic
    if ( ! empty($fields_values['header_content'] ) ) {
        echo "= " .   wp_kses_post( wptexturize( $fields_values['header_content'] ) )  . " \n\n";
        echo "----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n";
    }
    // ... content ...
    if ( ! empty( $fields_values['footer_content'] ) ) {
        echo "\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n";
        echo ( wp_kses_post( wptexturize( $fields_values['footer_content'] ) ) );
    }
    ```
    -   **Sanitization**: Like the other templates, it uses `wp_kses_post()` to strip any HTML tags from the content and `wptexturize()` to improve typography.

## Features Enabled

This file is a passive template and does not directly enable any features in the admin panel.

### Admin Menu

-   This file has no effect on the WordPress admin menu or any settings pages.

### User-Facing

-   This file provides the **styled plain-text version** of the "Standard" HTML emails. When a user receives a multipart email, their client will display this version if it cannot or is configured not to display HTML. The text-based separators make the email significantly more organized and easier to read than an unformatted block of text.

## Extension Opportunities

Directly modifying this template file is not recommended, as any changes would be overwritten during a plugin update.

-   **Safe Extension Method**: The `WPBC_Emails_API` class provides a filter, `wpbc_email_api_get_plain_content_after`, which is the ideal place to modify the plain-text content. A developer could hook into this filter to apply their own custom text formatting, such as using different separators, adding a custom signature, or re-ordering the content.

    ```php
    function my_custom_plain_text_formatter( $plain_text_content, $email_id, $fields_values ) {
        // Example: Replace the default separator with asterisks
        $plain_text_content = str_replace("---------------------------------------------------------------------", "*********************************************************************", $plain_text_content);
        return $plain_text_content;
    }
    add_filter( 'wpbc_email_api_get_plain_content_after', 'my_custom_plain_text_formatter', 10, 3 );
    ```

-   **Potential Risks**: Any modifications should ensure that the output remains pure plain text to avoid issues with email clients.

## Next File Recommendations

Having now analyzed the entire suite of email templates, our understanding of the email view layer is complete. It is time to move on to other major, un-analyzed core features of the plugin. The following files are the most logical and important next steps:

1.  **`core/sync/wpbc-gcal.php`** — **Top Priority.** This file is responsible for the Google Calendar synchronization feature. Analyzing it will reveal how the plugin handles complex, authenticated interactions with a major third-party API and manages data syncing.
2.  **`core/timeline/flex-timeline.php`** — The booking "Timeline" is a core administrative UI. This file will show how booking data is queried and rendered in a visual timeline format, providing insight into the plugin's data visualization techniques.
3.  **`core/class/wpbc-class-notices.php`** — This file likely defines a standardized system for creating and displaying admin notices throughout the plugin. Understanding it is key to learning how the plugin communicates important information to the site administrator.
