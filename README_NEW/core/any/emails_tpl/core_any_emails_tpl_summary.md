File-by-File Summaries
core/any/emails_tpl/index.php
• Source MD file name: index.php-analysis.md
• Role: This file serves as a security measure to prevent directory listing within the core/any/emails_tpl/ directory by presenting a blank page if accessed directly.
• Key Technical Details: It contains no functions, classes, hooks, WordPress core interactions, or database interactions. Its purpose is fulfilled by its mere existence.
• Features (Admin vs User): This file does not enable any features for either the admin or user-facing sides of the site, nor does it add UI elements or register any front-end components.
• Top Extension Opportunities: There are no opportunities or reasons to extend this file. Modifying or deleting it is not recommended as it could expose directory contents.
• Suggested Next Files (from that MD):
    1. core/sync/wpbc-gcal.php: Central to Google Calendar synchronization, likely involves external API communication and cron jobs.
    2. core/timeline/flex-timeline.php: Probably generates the timeline view for bookings, a key UI component.
    3. core/class/wpbc-class-notices.php: Likely manages the display of admin notices.
plain-html-tpl.php
• Source MD file name: plain-html-tpl.php-analysis.md
• Role: This PHP template generates a basic, universally compatible HTML structure for emails, acting as a view layer component within the plugin's core email engine (WPBC_Emails_API).
• Key Technical Details: Contains wpbc_email_template_plain_html( $fields_values ) function. Uses ob_start() and ob_get_clean() for output buffering. Sanitizes content using wp_kses_post() and wptexturize(). Replaces <h2> tags with <p> tags with inline CSS for heading presentation in emails. Includes commented-out code for dynamic color customization.
• Features (Admin vs User): It does not directly enable admin panel features. For users, it generates the final HTML structure for notification emails, ensuring proper formatting as an HTML document.
• Top Extension Opportunities: Creating a new, custom template file is the ideal way to customize email appearance, but requires a filter in the WPBC_Emails_API class for registration. Alternatively, the wpbc_email_api_get_content_after filter can modify the final email body. Re-enabling color customization and adding more inline styling logic are suggested improvements.
• Suggested Next Files (from that MD):
    1. core/sync/wpbc-gcal.php: Top priority for Google Calendar sync, third-party API interaction, and data syncing.
    2. core/timeline/flex-timeline.php: Core administrative UI for booking data visualization.
    3. core/class/wpbc-class-notices.php: Likely defines a standardized system for admin notices.
plain-text-tpl.php
• Source MD file name: plain-text-tpl.php-analysis.md
• Role: This PHP template generates the plain-text version of emails sent by the plugin, ensuring maximum compatibility and accessibility.
• Key Technical Details: Contains wpbc_email_template_plain_text( $fields_values ) function. Uses ob_start() and ob_get_clean(). Concatenates header, content, and footer with double newlines. Crucially, it uses wp_kses_post() to strip all HTML tags, ensuring pure plain text output, and wptexturize() for typography.
• Features (Admin vs User): It does not directly enable admin panel features. For users, it provides the plain-text alternative for all emails, critical for accessibility, compatibility with older clients, and multipart emails.
• Top Extension Opportunities: The wpbc_email_api_get_plain_content_after hook in the WPBC_Emails_API class is the ideal place to modify the plain-text content, allowing for additional text transformations or reformatting. Custom logic should ensure pure plain text output.
• Suggested Next Files (from that MD):
    1. core/sync/wpbc-gcal.php: Top priority for Google Calendar sync, third-party API interaction, and data syncing.
    2. core/timeline/flex-timeline.php: Core administrative UI for booking data visualization.
    3. core/class/wpbc-class-notices.php: Likely defines a standardized system for admin notices.
standard-html-tpl.php
• Source MD file name: standard-html-tpl.php-analysis.md
• Role: This sophisticated PHP template generates a fully-featured, responsive HTML email, serving as the "Standard" styled email template with a professional look and customizable colors.
• Key Technical Details: Defines wpbc_email_template_standard_html( $fields_values ) function. Dynamically injects inline CSS styles using sanitize_hex_color for custom colors (base, background, body, text). Utilizes a table-based layout for consistent rendering across email clients. Employs a hybrid styling approach with embedded CSS (<style> block) and inline CSS. Includes responsive design with @media queries. Incorporates special MSO (Microsoft Office) conditional comments for Outlook compatibility fixes. Contains developer notes hinting at its origin from a static HTML template processed by an inliner tool.
• Features (Admin vs User): It does not directly enable admin panel features. For users, it generates the final, professionally styled HTML email, providing a branded and responsive reading experience for booking notifications.
• Top Extension Opportunities: The safest approach for significant layout changes is to create a new template file, registering it via a filter in WPBC_Emails_API (if available). For smaller changes, the wpbc_email_api_get_content_after filter can modify content before it's wrapped by this template. Modifications are risky due to sensitive table-based layouts and Outlook comments, requiring thorough testing.
• Suggested Next Files (from that MD):
    1. core/sync/wpbc-gcal.php: Top priority for Google Calendar sync, third-party API interaction, and data syncing.
    2. core/timeline/flex-timeline.php: Core administrative UI for booking data visualization.
    3. core/class/wpbc-class-notices.php: Likely defines a standardized system for admin notices.
