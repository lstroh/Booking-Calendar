File-by-File Summaries
core/any/activation.php
Section
Details
Source MD file name
activation.php-analysis.md
Role (short sentence)
This file manages the plugin's lifecycle (activation, deactivation, and updates) and enhances the admin user experience on the WordPress Plugins page.
Key Technical Details
Defines the abstract class WPBC_Install which handles plugin lifecycle hooks. Uses core hooks like register_activation_hook and register_deactivation_hook. Stores plugin version (booking\_version\_num) and data deletion preference (booking\_is\_delete\_if\_deactive) in the database options.
Features (Admin vs User)
Admin: Adds action links ("Settings," "Start Setup Wizard") and version meta information to the plugins.php page. Enables a post-activation redirect to a welcome screen. User: Has no direct impact on the user-facing side of the website.
Top Extension Opportunities
Use the custom actions make_bk_action( 'wpbc_activation' ) to perform custom setup tasks (like table creation) upon plugin activation/update, or make_bk_action( 'wpbc_deactivation' ) for cleanup.

core/any/admin-bs-ui.php
Section
Details
Source MD file name
admin-bs-ui.md
Role (short sentence)
Provides a library of procedural helper functions for generating consistent, Bootstrap-style UI components like buttons, dropdowns, and input groups across the admin pages.
Key Technical Details
Contains procedural functions such as wpbc_bs_button(), wpbc_bs_select(), and the complex composite function wpbc_bs_dropdown_list(). Includes wpbc_bs_javascript_tooltips() to initialize the Tippy.js tooltip library.
Features (Admin vs User)
Admin: Provides the reusable UI components (buttons with icons, complex input groups, tabbed navigation) that form the admin panel structure. User: Has no user-facing features.
Top Extension Opportunities
The primary extension pattern is reusing the UI functions (e.g., wpbc_bs_button()) when creating new custom admin pages to maintain the plugin's consistent style.

core/any/api-emails.php
Section
Details
Source MD file name
api-emails.md
Role (short sentence)
Defines the abstract API (WPBC_Emails_API) which acts as the core engine for the entire email notification system, standardizing the creation, storage, and sending of transactional emails.
Key Technical Details
The abstract class WPBC_Emails_API extends WPBC_Settings_API. Child classes must implement init_settings_fields() to define template structure. It includes a shortcode replacement engine (e.g., replacing [booking_id]). It uses the send() method to call wp_mail() and handles multipart content via the phpmailer_init hook.
Features (Admin vs User)
Admin: Provides the framework for creating the settings pages found under Booking > Settings > Emails. User: Sends all transactional emails (confirmations, notifications) to both site visitors and administrators.
Top Extension Opportunities
Create a new class extending WPBC_Emails_API to define a custom email template. Use the filter wpbc_email_api_is_allow_send as a "kill switch" to conditionally prevent emails from being sent.

core/any/class-admin-menu.php
Section
Details
Source MD file name
class-admin-menu.md, class-admin-menu_ver2.md
Role (short sentence)
Defines the object-oriented factory class (WPBC_Admin_Menus) that standardizes the process of registering all top-level and submenu pages in the WordPress admin interface.
Key Technical Details
Implements the content delegation pattern: the content() method fires do_action('wpbc_page_structure_show', $menu_tag) instead of rendering content directly. A key feature is efficient asset loading achieved by using page-specific hooks (admin_print_styles-{$page}) to load CSS/JS only where needed.
Features (Admin vs User)
Admin: The foundational engine for the entire admin menu structure (e.g., "Bookings," "Settings"). It correctly maps simplified user roles (e.g., 'editor') to WordPress capabilities. User: Exclusively for the backend interface.
Top Extension Opportunities
Instantiate the WPBC_Admin_Menus class to create custom admin pages that integrate into the plugin’s menu structure. Use delegation hooks like wpbc_page_structure_show to inject content or wpbc_define_nav_tabs to add navigation tabs to existing pages.
Suggested Next Files
core/admin/page-new.php, includes/page-availability/availability__page.php, core/any/api-emails.php (from MD 1); core/any/api-emails.php, core/admin/wpbc-gutenberg.php, core/sync/wpbc-gcal.php (from MD 2).
core/any/class-admin-settings-api.php
Section
Details
Source MD file name
class-admin-settings-api.md
Role (short sentence)
Abstract class (WPBC_Settings_API) providing a custom, object-oriented framework for defining, displaying, validating, and saving all configuration settings for the plugin.
Key Technical Details
Abstract class that requires child classes to implement init_settings_fields() to define the settings array. It uses static methods (e.g., field_text_row_static()) to generate field HTML and implements a detailed validation engine (validate_post()) using WordPress sanitation functions. Supports saving settings as a single serialized array or as individual options.
Features (Admin vs User)
Admin: Provides the foundational API that enables other components (like General Settings) to rapidly build complex, consistent settings interfaces. User: No direct user-facing features.
Top Extension Opportunities
Create a new class that extends WPBC_Settings_API and implements init_settings_fields() to create a new group of custom settings. The wpbc_fields_after_saving_to_db filter allows triggering side effects after settings are saved.
Suggested Next Files
core/admin/api-settings.php, core/any/admin-bs-ui.php, core/wpbc-js.php.
core/any/class-css-js.php
Section
Details
Source MD file name
class-css-js.php-analysis.md
Role (short sentence)
Abstract base class (WPBC_JS_CSS) that provides a standardized, performance-oriented framework for registering and conditionally loading all CSS and JavaScript assets.
Key Technical Details
Implements a two-phase asset loading system (Registration vs. Enqueuing). It uses core hooks (admin_enqueue_scripts) for registration but custom plugin actions (wpbc_load_js_on_admin_page) for conditional loading. Includes abstract methods like define() and remove_conflicts().
Features (Admin vs User)
Admin: Enables the loading of necessary CSS and JavaScript only on specific plugin pages, improving backend performance. User: Provides the framework for loading required CSS/JS for front-end booking forms. The filter wpbc_is_load_script_on_this_page controls the core performance feature "Load JS/CSS only on specific pages".
Top Extension Opportunities
Use the custom actions wpbc_enqueue_style and wpbc_enqueue_script to safely add custom assets after the plugin's core assets have loaded. The filter wpbc_is_load_script_on_this_page can be used to programmatically prevent asset loading.

core/any/index.php
Section
Details
Source MD file name
index.php-analysis.md
Role (short sentence)
A standard WordPress security measure whose sole purpose is to prevent directory listing on the web server.
Key Technical Details
Contains no executable PHP code, functions, classes, or hooks, only the comment <?php // Silence is golden. ?>.
Features (Admin vs User)
Admin/User: Does not implement, enable, or influence any plugin features.
Top Extension Opportunities
None; this file is strictly a security placeholder and should not be modified.

Common Features and Patterns
Across the analyzed files, several architectural patterns emerge that define the plugin's structure:
1. Custom, Abstracted Frameworks: The plugin heavily relies on custom, object-oriented, abstract base classes (e.g., WPBC_Install, WPBC_Admin_Menus, WPBC_Settings_API, WPBC_JS_CSS) instead of exclusively using standard WordPress APIs. These classes provide specific templates for defining settings, menus, and assets.
2. Performance and Conditional Loading: There is a strong emphasis on backend performance. The Asset API (WPBC_JS_CSS) utilizes a two-phase registration/enqueuing system to load assets only where needed. Similarly, the Menu API (WPBC_Admin_Menus) uses page-specific hooks (admin_print_styles-$page) to prevent CSS/JS from loading globally on the admin side.
3. Delegation and Separation of Concerns: Core components are designed to handle "scaffolding" while delegating the content and specific logic to other modules. For instance, WPBC_Admin_Menus creates the page but uses the wpbc_page_structure_show action hook to trigger content rendering in a separate file.
4. Extensive Use of Custom Hooks: The systems are built to be extended internally and externally through a large number of custom action and filter hooks, typically prefixed with wpbc\_ or make\_bk\_action (e.g., wpbc_activation, wpbc_define_nav_tabs, wpbc_enqueue_script).
5. Focus on Backend Consistency: Helper libraries like core/any/admin-bs-ui.php standardize the look and feel of form components (buttons, dropdowns, input groups) across all custom admin pages.
