Booking Calendar Plugin: Timeline and Character List
Timeline of Main Events
This timeline details the development and architectural aspects of the Booking Calendar plugin's administrative user interface, as gleaned from the provided CSS file analyses. The events focus on the introduction and refinement of styling and layout features.

Early Development (Implied): Foundation of Admin UI
The plugin establishes a standard WordPress list table structure, indicated by the .widefat selector in admin-br-table.css.
Basic administrative notices and messages are implemented, styled to align with WordPress core UI (e.g., .notice, .notice-success in admin-support.css).
Placeholder text styling is introduced for input fields in settings pages (settings-page.css).
A security measure (index.php) is placed in the CSS directories to prevent directory listing.
Refinement of Data Presentation (Concurrent/Iterative)
Introduction of Custom Resource Tables: The admin-br-table.css stylesheet is developed to style tables for "booking resources," applying custom looks, responsive behaviors, and color-coded status indicators (e.g., .label-pending, .label-approved).
Development of Booking Listing Page Styling: admin-listing-table.css is created to format individual booking rows on the main "Booking Listing" page. This includes highlighting submitted form values (.fieldvalue), color-coding various statuses (.label-*, .payment-label-*), and responsive adjustments.
Advanced Flexible Table System: wpbc_flextable.css is introduced, utilizing CSS Flexbox for highly flexible and responsive data grids, replacing traditional HTML tables for managing resources and prices. This includes features like fixed/flexible column sizing, container queries, striped rows, selected row states, and folder tree UI.
Establishment of Custom Navigation and Layout (Concurrent/Iterative)
Two-Level Tabbed Navigation System: admin-menu.css is implemented to define the look and feel of a custom, two-level tabbed navigation system across admin pages (top-level tabs via .wpdvlp-top-tabs and sub-tabs via .wpdvlp-sub-tabs). This includes active/inactive states, promotional labels (.wpbc_new_label, .wpbc_pro_label), and responsive adaptations for mobile.
Settings Page Layout: settings-page.css is developed to structure administrative settings pages, establishing a two-column layout (main content and sidebar) and ensuring consistency for WordPress UI elements like meta-boxes.
Interactive Admin Toolbars: admin-toolbar.css is created to style the interactive toolbars on main admin pages (e.g., Booking Listing, Timeline), focusing on complex UI elements like button groups, input groups, and customized dropdown menus for filtering and actions. This includes responsive behaviors for mobile.
Continuous Improvement: Responsive Design Integration (Throughout)
Media queries (@media (max-width: 782px), @media (max-width: 600px)) are integrated into all relevant CSS files (admin-br-table.css, admin-listing-table.css, admin-menu.css, admin-toolbar.css, settings-page.css, wpbc_flextable.css) to ensure the administrative interface is functional and readable across various screen sizes (tablet, mobile).
CSS keyframe animations (@keyframes spin) are added to admin-support.css for AJAX loading indicators, improving user feedback during background processes.
Cast of Characters
The provided sources primarily describe files and their functionalities rather than individuals or organizations. However, we can infer the "characters" involved in the plugin's ecosystem.

The Booking Calendar Plugin (Primary Entity)
Bio: The central software entity. Its core purpose is to manage booking resources and facilitate calendar-based scheduling. The analyzed CSS files collectively define its administrative interface, ensuring it is visually organized, user-friendly, responsive, and provides clear feedback to administrators. Its architecture includes distinct stylesheets for different admin sections (resource tables, booking listings, navigation, settings, toolbars, and general support utilities).
The Plugin Developers (Implied Creators/Maintainers)
Bio: The unseen individuals or team responsible for writing, maintaining, and updating the Booking Calendar plugin. Their work is reflected in the structured CSS, the choice of modern techniques (Flexbox, container queries), the implementation of WordPress best practices (silent index, enqueuing styles), and the foresight for extension opportunities. They design the HTML structures that the CSS targets and are responsible for the overall architectural decisions.
The WordPress Administrator / Site Owner (Primary User)
Bio: The target user of the plugin's administrative interface. This individual manages booking resources, reviews booking listings, adjusts plugin settings, and utilizes features like Google Calendar synchronization. The entire admin-facing CSS is designed to enhance their experience by providing clarity, visual cues (color-coded statuses, highlighted form values), and a responsive interface, allowing them to efficiently manage bookings from any device.
The Website User / Booker (Front-End User - Not Directly Affected by these Sources)
Bio: The individual who interacts with the user-facing side of the website to make bookings. While their experience is crucial to the plugin's purpose, the analyzed CSS files are explicitly stated to have no effect on the user-facing interface. Their interaction is through front-end forms and calendars, which would be styled by separate stylesheets not covered here.
WordPress Core (Platform Provider)
Bio: The underlying content management system that hosts the Booking Calendar plugin. The plugin's CSS frequently interacts with and overrides WordPress core styles (e.g., .widefat tables, admin notices, meta-box icons) to integrate seamlessly while establishing its own distinct branding and UI patterns. It provides the environment and many base UI elements that the plugin builds upon.
Third-Party APIs (e.g., Google Calendar - Implied Integration Target)
Bio: External services with which the plugin integrates, such as Google Calendar. While not directly detailed in the CSS files, the mention of core/sync/wpbc-gcal.php as a "major, complex feature" indicates that the plugin communicates with such APIs for critical functionalities like synchronization.
