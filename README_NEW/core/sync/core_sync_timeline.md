Based on the provided sources, here is a detailed timeline and a cast of characters for the main events and components of the Google Calendar Synchronization feature within the Booking Calendar plugin.

Detailed Timeline of Google Calendar Synchronization
The timeline outlines the sequence of technical events and administrative actions involved in configuring, activating, and executing the one-way synchronization of events from Google Calendar to the Booking Calendar plugin.

Approximate Time / TriggerEventDetailsComponents InvolvedPlugin ActivationConfiguration InitializationThe wpbc_sync_gcal_activate() function, hooked to wpbc_other_versions_activation, executes. It uses add_bk_option() to create and set default values for all necessary Google Calendar settings (e.g., API Key, max events, timezone) in the WordPress database (wp_options table).wpbc-gcal.phpAdministrator ActionSystem ConfigurationAn administrator navigates to the Booking > Settings > Sync > Google Calendar page. Functions like wpbc_gcal_settings_content_field_*() render the necessary HTML/JavaScript fields, allowing the admin to input settings such as the Google Calendar ID, API Key, import time window (from/until), and field mappings.wpbc-gcal.phpScheduled/Manual TriggerImport Initiation (Cron Job)The custom cron system triggers the wpbc_silent_import_all_events() function (hooked to the wpbc_silent_import_all_events action) for automated background synchronization. Alternatively, an administrator triggers a manual import.wpbc-gcal.php, WPBC_CronPhase 1: Setup & ConfigurationInstantiation of Core Enginewpbc_silent_import_all_events() instantiates the primary class: WPBC_Google_Calendar. It retrieves configured settings (get_bk_option()) and uses the class's setter methods (setUrl(), setResource(), etc.) to configure the specific import job.wpbc-gcal.php, WPBC_Google_CalendarPhase 2: Data FetchingAPI Request ConstructionThe run() method of WPBC_Google_Calendar constructs the request URL for the Google Calendar API v3, incorporating the configured Calendar ID, API Key (booking_gcal_api_key), and time window parameters.WPBC_Google_CalendarPhase 3: Communication & ValidationExternal CommunicationThe class uses the WordPress function wp_remote_get() to execute the HTTP API call to Google. Robust error handling checks for WP_Error objects and non-200 HTTP status codes (e.g., 403 Forbidden, 404 Not Found).WPBC_Google_CalendarPhase 4: Data ProcessingData Parsing & Pre-CheckOn a successful response, json_decode() parses the Google JSON feed. The getExistBookings_gid() method performs a direct $wpdb query on the local wp_booking table to identify which Google event IDs (sync_gid) have already been imported, preventing duplicates.WPBC_Google_CalendarPhase 5: Booking CreationEvent Transformation & SavingThe class iterates through each unique Google event. It extracts details (title, start/end time), converts dates using getCommaSeparatedDates(), and applies the admin-configured field mapping (booking_gcal_events_form_fields). For each new event, it assembles a $submit_array.WPBC_Google_CalendarFinal Step: Database IntegrationBooking InsertionThe createNewBookingsFromEvents() method calls the global wpbc_booking_save() function for each new event. This delegates the final database insertion to the plugin's core booking engine. Crucially, this step triggers action hooks (e.g., wpbc_track_new_booking) that developers can use for post-import actions.WPBC_Google_CalendarPost-Import (Manual)Admin FeedbackAfter a manual import, the showImportedEvents() method generates an HTML table to display a summary of the newly created bookings to the administrator.WPBC_Google_CalendarPlugin DeactivationSystem CleanupThe wpbc_sync_gcal_deactivate() function, hooked to wpbc_other_versions_deactivation, executes. It calls delete_bk_option() to remove all Google Calendar settings from the database, ensuring a clean uninstall.wpbc-gcal.phpCast of Characters (Principle Components)
This list includes the main classes and functions responsible for orchestrating the synchronization feature.

Component NameTypeBrief BioWPBC_Google_CalendarClassThe core engine for the one-way synchronization feature. It is a self-contained service responsible for API communication, handling errors, parsing Google JSON data, mapping fields, checking for duplicate bookings (getExistBookings_gid()), and ultimately calling the core booking creation function (wpbc_booking_save()).wpbc_silent_import_all_events()FunctionThe primary controller function executed by the cron scheduler (WPBC_Cron). It reads all necessary settings from the database, instantiates the WPBC_Google_Calendar class, configures the import job (handling single global URLs or multiple resource-specific URLs for paid versions), and triggers the run() process.WPBC_CronClass (Implied)The plugin's custom cron system responsible for triggering the scheduled execution of the wpbc_silent_import_all_events() function at set intervals, enabling automated synchronization.wpbc_booking_save()Function (Global)The critical integration point and core booking creation engine of the plugin. It is called by WPBC_Google_Calendar to perform the final database insertion of the imported Google event as a new local booking. It is known to fire important action hooks for developers.wpbc_sync_gcal_activate()FunctionA lifecycle function executed upon plugin activation. Its role is to use add_bk_option() to initialize all Google Calendar settings with default values in the plugin's database options.wpbc_gcal_settings_content_field_*()Suite of FunctionsUI helper functions (e.g., wpbc_gcal_settings_content_field_from). These functions generate and render the HTML and JavaScript for the configuration fields on the Settings > Sync > Google Calendar admin page, allowing configuration of the API key, time windows, and other parameters.$wpdbObject (Global)The standard WordPress database access object. It is used directly by the getExistBookings_gid() method within WPBC_Google_Calendar to query the local wp_booking table and check for existing Google event IDs (sync_gid) to prevent duplicate imports.
