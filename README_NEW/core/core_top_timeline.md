The provided sources offer a deep architectural insight into the Booking Calendar plugin for WordPress, focusing heavily on its core utilities, data flow, developer APIs, and client-side asset management, rather than a narrative history.

Based on the analysis of file roles and dependencies, here is a detailed timeline of the plugin's operational flow, followed by a cast of characters.

Detailed Timeline of Main Events (Operational Flow)
The timeline describes the sequence of architectural events, from plugin loading to a successful booking submission.

Phase 1: Plugin Initialization and Architecture Setup (Server-Side)
TimeframeEvent / ActionKey Files InvolvedDescriptionPlugin ActivationInitial Setup and DB Checkcore/wpbc-activation.phpThe plugin's activation logic runs, likely checking for or creating necessary custom database tables ({$wpdb->prefix}booking, {$wpdb->prefix}bookingdates).WordPress InitCore Initializationcore/wpbc.php, wpdev-booking.phpThe main Booking_Calendar singleton class is instantiated. It checks WordPress version compatibility and loads foundational dependencies via includes/wpbc-include.php.Early LoadEstablishing Core Utilitiescore/wpbc-core.phpThe foundational architectural layer is established, implementing the custom internal hook system (add_bk_action, apply_bk_filter) and data wrappers (get_bk_option, wpbc_get_booking_meta_option).Plugins LoadedTranslation and Localizationcore/wpbc-translation.phpThe i18n/l10n engine loads, detecting the correct locale (with special checks for Polylang/WPML/AJAX requests) and loading the appropriate language files.Admin Panel AccessAdmin Menu Constructioncore/wpbc.php (via WPBC_Admin_Menus)The main admin menu structure is registered, including top-level pages for "Bookings," "Add Booking," "Settings," "Availability," and "Resources."Asset QueueingLoading Scripts and Stylescore/wpbc-css.php, core/wpbc-js.phpThe asset controllers hook into WordPress to conditionally enqueue CSS (wpbc-all-admin.min.css, calendar skins) and JS (wpbc_all.js, admin.js, client.js), ensuring conflict prevention (dequeueing known conflicting assets) and correct loading order (removing async/defer).Data Bridge SetupLocalizing JS Variablescore/wpbc-js-vars.phpServer-side configuration, translated messages, timezone information, and AJAX URLs are gathered, formatted into a resilient JavaScript bootstrap loader, and injected into the page, populating the global _wpbc object.Phase 2: Frontend Rendering (User Interaction)
TimeframeEvent / ActionKey Files InvolvedDescriptionShortcode RenderRendering the Booking Formwpdev-booking.php (Shortcode registration), includes/page-form-simple/form_simple.php (Likely)The [booking] shortcode executes, rendering the HTML structure for the calendar and form elements.Form DefinitionParsing Custom Form Syntaxcore/form_parser.phpIf the form is custom, this utility parses the admin-configured shortcode-like syntax (e.g., [text* your-name]) into a structured PHP array, which is then used to generate the final HTML form fields.Date DisplayLocalizing Dates and Timescore/wpbc-dates.php, core/wpbc_functions_dates.phpThe dates engine calculates availability and formats all displayed dates and times (e.g., calendar dates, ranges, prices) using localization utilities to ensure they respect the site's timezone and locale settings.Client-Side ReadyActivating Interactivityjs/client.jsThe main front-end script initializes, using the data in the global _wpbc object to configure the calendar, handle user clicks, perform client-side validation, and prepare for AJAX submission.Phase 3: Booking Submission and Workflow (Data Flow)
| Timeframe | Event / Action | Key Files Involved | Description | | | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | | Booking Attempt | API Call / Availability Check | core/wpbc-dev-api.php | The client-side form submits data via AJAX to the server. The internal logic (or external developers using the API) calls wpbc_api_is_dates_booked() to confirm availability using the same logic as the core booking engine. | | Data Processing | Saving the Booking Record | core/lib/wpbc-booking-new.php (Likely), core/wpbc-core.php | The server-side logic receives the submission, sanitizes and validates the data, and calls the core function (e.g., wpbc_booking_save). The booking and its associated dates are inserted into the custom DB tables (booking, bookingdates). | | Metadata & Logging| Saving Meta Options | core/wpbc-core.php, core/wpbc_functions.php | Custom form fields and internal settings related to the booking are serialized and saved in the booking_options column via wpbc_save_booking_meta_option(). Workflow logs are recorded via wpbc_db__add_log_info. | | Status Update | Handling New Booking Status | core/wpbc_functions.php, includes/page-bookings/bookings__actions.php | Workflow functions (e.g., wpbc_auto_approve_booking) determine the new status (pending or approved) and update the database, triggering the wpbc_booking_inserted action. | | Notification | Sending Transactional Emails | core/wpbc-emails.php | The email workflow is initiated. Helper functions validate the recipient, format the subject/body using translated shortcodes, and wrap the email in a custom PHP mailer class (wpbc_wp_mail) to ensure correct headers and reliable delivery. | | Admin Feedback | Displaying Admin Notice | core/wpbc-debug.php (via wpbc_admin_show_top_notice) | If the booking was made via the admin panel, a dynamic, dismissible notice confirms the action, leveraging the debugging utility functions. |

Cast of Characters (Principle People and Entities)
The sources primarily mention architectural components and systems, which are treated as the main "characters" driving the plugin's functionality.

Character / EntityRole in the PluginBrief BioBooking_CalendarThe Orchestrator / SingletonThe main class defined in core/wpbc.php. It is responsible for the entire plugin lifecycle, from version compatibility checks to initializing all major subsystems (menus, CSS, JS, core booking objects). It enforces the singleton pattern, ensuring only one instance of the plugin runs.$wpdev_bk_action / $wpdev_bk_filterThe Custom Hook SystemGlobal variables defined and managed by core/wpbc-core.php. They hold the callback arrays for the plugin's custom action and filter system, which mimics WordPress hooks but operates internally for modular communication and extensibility.WPBC_CSSThe Style ControllerThe class responsible for managing all CSS assets (core/wpbc-css.php). It loads core styles, admin-specific styles, calendar skins, and proactively dequeues known conflicting CSS from other plugins/themes.WPBC_JSThe Script ControllerThe class responsible for managing all JavaScript assets (core/wpbc-js.php). It enqueues front-end and admin scripts, loads third-party libraries, and critically, filters the script tags to remove async/defer attributes to prevent execution race conditions._wpbc (JavaScript Object)The Data BridgeThe global JavaScript object populated by core/wpbc-js-vars.php. It carries all server-side data (settings, translations, timezones, AJAX URLs) to the client-side scripts (js/client.js, js/admin.js), enabling dynamic front-end configuration.The Form ParserThe TranslatorThe utility logic within core/form_parser.php. Its sole role is to translate the raw, text-based, shortcode-like configuration string defined by the administrator into a structured PHP array for rendering and processing.The Date EngineThe Time KeeperThe collective logic across core/wpbc-dates.php and core/wpbc_functions_dates.php. This engine manages all date/time calculations, availability checks, database queries for booked dates, and ensures all date outputs are correctly localized and timezone-aware for the user.The Developer APIThe Public InterfaceThe functions defined in core/wpbc-dev-api.php. These functions (wpbc_api_booking_add_new, wpbc_api_is_dates_booked) provide a stable, documented interface for external developers to interact with the plugin without needing to know the complex internal data structure.The Translation EngineThe LinguistThe system managed by core/wpbc-translation.php. It handles standard .mo file loading, provides compatibility with Polylang/WPML, and implements the powerful custom inline translation shortcode ([lang=xx_XX]).The DebuggerThe TroubleshooterThe utility functions in core/wpbc-debug.php. This component provides tools for developers to inspect variables (debuge), display structured errors, check server configurations (like Suhosin limits), and show dynamic admin notices.
