Plugin Component Briefing: The "Flex Timeline" Feature (V2)
This briefing reviews the architectural and functional components that constitute the modern, flexible booking timeline feature (V2) of the plugin. This feature provides a crucial Gantt-chart-like visualization of booking data for both administrators and front-end users.

1. Timeline Core Logic and Data Processing (PHP)
The core functionality of the timeline is contained within the WPBC_TimelineFlex class. This class acts as the engine for generating the entire visual timeline structure.

Main Themes and Facts:
Engine Class: The feature is driven by the WPBC_TimelineFlex class defined in wpbc-class-timeline_v2.php. This class is a "versatile component" initialized for admin, client (via shortcode), or AJAX contexts.
Backward Compatibility Loader: An earlier file, flex-timeline.php, exists purely as a simple "loader or bridge" to maintain old file paths while delegating all responsibility to the new code: core/timeline/v2/wpbc-class-timeline_v2.php. This demonstrates a refactoring pattern used for backward compatibility.
Initialization Contexts: The class supports three distinct initialization methods based on the request source:
admin_init(): For the Booking > Timeline admin page, fetching parameters from $_REQUEST.
client_init( $attr ): For the front-end, triggered by the [bookingtimeline] shortcode.
ajax_init( $attr ): For handling navigation requests (Next/Previous month).
Complex Data Transformation: The most critical and complex logic is in the wpbc_get_dates_and_times_for_timeline( $bookings ) method. It takes raw booking data and transforms it into two structured arrays ($dates_array and $time_array_new) necessary for visual rendering.
Handling Check-in/Check-out: The data processing logic for hourly slots is highly sophisticated, using the "last digit of the time's 'seconds' component (:01 for check-in, :02 for check-out)" to correctly process partial-day bookings and changeovers.
Security and Data Source: The class relies on the global function wpbc_get_bookings_objects() (which exists in core/admin/wpbc-sql.php) for data access, rather than querying the database directly. AJAX requests rely on a security nonce to prevent CSRF attacks.
Quote: "This file defines the WPBC_TimelineFlex class, the powerful engine responsible for rendering the booking Timeline—a Gantt-chart-like visual representation of bookings over time."

2. Dynamic Navigation (JavaScript)
The timeline's dynamic, smooth user experience is handled by the JavaScript file timeline_v2.js (and its source/output variants).

Main Themes and Facts:
Purpose: This script handles the "dynamic navigation" of the timeline, allowing users to move through different time periods (e.g., next month) using AJAX to provide a "smooth user experience without requiring a full page reload."
Core Function: The script's logic revolves around a single primary function: wpbc_flextimeline_nav(timeline_obj, nav_step).
AJAX Action Hook: Navigation triggers an AJAX POST request to the WordPress handler (admin-ajax.php) using the specific action hook: 'WPBC_FLEXTIMELINE_NAV'.
Response Handling: Upon successful response, the script uses the returned HTML and "injects the returned HTML directly into the timeline's container (.wpbc_timeline_ajax_replace), effectively redrawing the timeline."
Extension Point: The primary recommended method for developers to safely extend or hook into the navigation process is by listening for the custom jQuery event triggered at the start of the wpbc_flextimeline_nav function.
3. Visual Styling and Layout (CSS)
The visual presentation of the timeline is managed by the stylesheet timeline_v2.1.css (and its minified counterpart).

Main Themes and Facts:
Modern Layout: The layout is a visually appealing Gantt-chart-style interface, built entirely using CSS Flexbox. Selectors like .flex_tl_table and .flex_tl_table_row_bookings use display: flex for alignment and distribution.
Theming via Custom Properties: The stylesheet utilizes a modern approach to theming by defining a set of CSS Custom Properties (Variables) in the :root selector. This makes it "simple to change the entire color scheme by overriding just these variables."Example: background-color: var(--wpbc_timeline-booking-approved-color)
Styling Details: The CSS includes specific rules for:
Colored bars for bookings (.pending_booking, .approved_booking).
Visually indicating the start of a booking (.booking_id.start_new_booking applies a border-radius).
"Changeover Day Triangles" created using a "clever linear-gradient trick" to represent split days without extra HTML.
Responsiveness: Media queries, specifically @media (max-width:782px), are used for responsive design, often changing flex-flow to wrap and stack elements vertically on mobile devices.
Performance Artifact: The file timeline_v2.1.min.css is a "minified version" used solely for performance optimization. It is a build artifact and should never be edited directly.
4. Extension and Modification Recommendations
Across all analyzed components, the theme of extension is consistent: direct modification is strongly discouraged, and developers should use provided extension methods.

ComponentRecommended Safe Extension MethodPotential Risk of Direct ModificationPHP Logic (WPBC_TimelineFlex)Filter the data source via the wpbc_get_bookings_objects() function (outside this file).Breaking the highly complex and interdependent data processing logic, leading to incorrect availability displays.JavaScript (timeline_v2.js)Hook into the custom jQuery event triggered at the start of wpbc_flextimeline_nav.Changes will be overwritten as the file is a generated asset (_out).CSS Styling (timeline_v2.1.css)Override the CSS Custom Properties (variables) in a separate stylesheet.Changes will be overwritten on plugin updates.Loader File (flex-timeline.php)None—it is a pure loader.Could break the require_once path, causing a fatal error and disabling the feature entirely.5. Next Steps for Analysis
The analysis of the timeline feature's architecture is considered complete. The sources consistently recommend focusing on the following areas to understand the plugin's broader core structure:

includes/page-resource-free/page-resource-free.php: Top Priority. This file is key to understanding the plugin's core data model: how booking resources (the fundamental bookable items) are created and managed.
js/datepick/jquery.datepick.wpbc.9.0.js: Analysis of the customized core jQuery Datepick library is needed to understand low-level client-side logic for calendar rendering and date selection.
css/calendar.css: The base stylesheet for the calendar, which is fundamental to the overall front-end user experience.
