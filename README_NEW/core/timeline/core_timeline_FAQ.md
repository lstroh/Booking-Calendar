FAQ: The Flex Timeline Feature of the Booking Calendar Plugin
1. What is the primary function and architecture of the Flex Timeline feature?
The Flex Timeline is a core data visualization feature that provides a Gantt-chart-like representation of bookings over time. It is powered by the WPBC_TimelineFlex PHP class, which acts as the engine for rendering the timeline.

Architecturally, the feature is separated into three main components:

The Loader (flex-timeline.php): A minimalist bridge file ensuring backward compatibility by maintaining the original path but delegating all responsibility to the modern V2 implementation.
The Logic (WPBC_TimelineFlex class): The PHP engine responsible for fetching booking data via wpbc_get_bookings_objects(), processing it into a complex time-slot grid structure (handling check-in/check-out times precisely), and generating the complete HTML output for the grid.
The Presentation/Interaction (CSS and JS):
The styling (timeline_v2.1.css) uses modern CSS techniques like Flexbox and Custom Properties for a responsive, themable layout.
The JavaScript (timeline_v2.js) handles client-side dynamic navigation, using AJAX to fetch new time periods (like next/previous month) without a full page reload.
2. How does the Flex Timeline handle complex booking data and time slots?
The core complexity is managed by the wpbc_get_dates_and_times_for_timeline() method within the WPBC_TimelineFlex class. This function takes raw booking data and transforms it into structured arrays optimized for rendering the Gantt chart view.

It is particularly sophisticated in handling bookings with specific start and end times, including check-in and check-out days. It uses a specific logic that examines the "seconds" component of the time data (e.g., :01 for check-in and :02 for check-out) to correctly determine partial-day availability and accurately render the diagonal split-day triangles using CSS linear gradients.

3. Where is the Flex Timeline displayed in the plugin?
The Flex Timeline feature is designed for use in both the administrative backend and the public-facing frontend:

Admin Menu: It renders the complete data grid on the Booking > Timeline page, offering administrators a visual tool for managing availability across multiple resources.
User-Facing: It is enabled on the frontend via the [bookingtimeline] shortcode, allowing visitors to view resource availability. It also supports parameters like booking_hash to filter the view to show only a specific customer's bookings.
4. What technologies are used for the visual presentation and responsiveness of the timeline?
The visual presentation relies on modern CSS techniques for robustness and theming:

Layout: The entire grid structure is built using CSS Flexbox (display: flex) for selectors like .flex_tl_table and .flex_tl_table_row_bookings. This provides a more robust and responsive layout compared to traditional HTML tables.
Theming: The stylesheet begins by defining CSS Custom Properties (variables) in the :root selector. These variables control colors for items like approved and pending bookings, making it easy to change the entire color scheme by overriding a few variables.
Responsiveness: @media queries (specifically for max-width:782px) are used to adapt the layout for mobile devices, often stacking the resource titles and timeline rows vertically for better readability.
5. How does the timeline support dynamic navigation for users?
Dynamic navigation (e.g., viewing the next or previous month) is handled entirely on the client-side by the timeline_v2.js script using AJAX.

The core function, wpbc_flextimeline_nav(timeline_obj, nav_step), performs the following steps:

Triggers a custom jQuery event for extensibility.
Initiates an AJAX POST request to the WordPress handler (admin-ajax.php) using the action 'WPBC_FLEXTIMELINE_NAV'.
Sends the timeline's configuration, the navigation step, locale, and a security nonce.
The server-side PHP (WPBC_TimelineFlex::ajax_init()) re-renders the new time period's HTML.
The JavaScript receives the new HTML and injects it into the container, allowing the timeline to update seamlessly without a full page reload.
6. What is the recommended method for developers to customize the timeline's appearance?
Developers should avoid modifying the core plugin files (especially the machine-generated .min.css and the complex PHP logic). The safest and most effective methods for customization are:

Theming via CSS Custom Properties: Override the CSS Custom Properties (variables) defined in the timeline's stylesheet by creating a separate custom CSS file. This allows global changes to colors and appearance.
CSS Overrides: Use more specific CSS selectors in a custom stylesheet to override the default rules for visual tweaks.
JavaScript Hooks: Use the custom jQuery event triggered by the navigation function to execute custom JavaScript before or after the AJAX request, allowing for client-side manipulation or integration with analytics.
7. What is the purpose of files like flex-timeline.php and timeline_v2.1.min.css?
These files serve specific architectural or performance roles:

flex-timeline.php: This file acts purely as a loader or bridge. It contains no logic itself, only a require_once statement to load the modern v2/wpbc-class-timeline_v2.php. It exists primarily for backward compatibility, ensuring old plugin includes still function while directing execution to the updated code.
timeline_v2.1.min.css: This is the minified version of the source CSS. It is generated by removing all unnecessary characters (whitespace, comments) to create a smaller file size. Its sole purpose is performance optimization, reducing load times on a live website. It should never be edited directly.
8. What are the key remaining areas of the plugin that should be analyzed next, according to the sources?
The analysis of the timeline feature points directly to the need for understanding the plugin's core data model and low-level UI libraries:

Resource Management: The file includes/page-resource-free/page-resource-free.php is considered critical for understanding how booking resources (the fundamental bookable items) are created and managed in the free version of the plugin.
Calendar UI Library: The file js/datepick/jquery.datepick.wpbc.9.0.js should be analyzed to understand the low-level client-side logic for the core calendar UI, including date selection, rendering, and styling.
Base Calendar Styling: The file css/calendar.css is the fundamental stylesheet for the entire calendar component, which is crucial for understanding the default front-end user experience.
