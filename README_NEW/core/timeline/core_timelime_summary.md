File-by-File Summaries
core/timeline/flex-timeline.php
Source MD file name
flex-timeline.php-analysis.md
Role
This file acts as a simple loader or bridge for the plugin's timeline functionality. Its purpose is to maintain the original file path for backward compatibility while delegating responsibility to the modern implementation.
Key Technical Details
The file contains only one operative line: a require_once statement that includes v2/wpbc-class-timeline_v2.php. It defines no functions, classes, or hooks, and does not interact with the database or WordPress APIs.
Features (Admin vs User)
This file does not directly enable any features but enables the entire Timeline feature by loading the necessary implementation file. It has no direct impact on the Admin Menu or the User-Facing side.
Top Extension Opportunities
None. Modifying this file is strongly discouraged as it could break the require_once path and cause a fatal error, disabling the feature entirely.
Suggested Next Files (from that MD)
1. core/timeline/v2/wpbc-class-timeline_v2.php (Top Priority)
2. includes/page-resource-free/page-resource-free.php
3. js/datepick/jquery.datepick.wpbc.9.0.js
core/timeline/v2/_src/timeline_v2.1.css
Source MD file name
timeline_v2.1.css-analysis.md
Role
This is the dedicated source stylesheet for the modern, flexbox-based booking timeline, providing all visual styling for the Gantt-chart-style interface.
Key Technical Details
The file is pure CSS with no PHP or JavaScript logic. It utilizes CSS Custom Properties (variables defined in :root) for centralized theming. The layout relies on CSS Flexbox (selectors like .flex_tl_table) for alignment and responsiveness. It includes Responsive Design via @media (max-width:782px) queries and uses a linear-gradient trick to create changeover day triangles.
Features (Admin vs User)
Provides complete visual presentation for the booking timeline. It styles the grid on the Booking > Timeline admin page and styles the output of the [bookingtimeline] shortcode on the front-end.
Top Extension Opportunities
The safest and most intended way to customize appearance is to override the CSS Custom Properties in a separate stylesheet. Developers can also write more specific CSS selectors to override default rules.

3. css/calendar.css
core/timeline/v2/_out/timeline_v2.1.min.css
Source MD file name
timeline_v2.1.min.css-analysis.md
Role
This file is the minified version of timeline_v2.1.css, serving primarily for performance optimization by reducing file size on a live website.
Key Technical Details
It is a build artifact and contains the exact same CSS rules as the source, compressed into a single line. It includes a sourceMappingURL comment to allow browser developer tools to link back to the readable source for debugging.
Features (Admin vs User)
Provides the same visual styling for the timeline on the Booking > Timeline admin page and for the [bookingtimeline] shortcode.
Top Extension Opportunities
This file should never be edited directly. Customizations must target the unminified source file (timeline_v2.1.css) by using external stylesheets to override CSS Custom Properties or specific rules.

core/timeline/v2/_src/timeline_v2.js
Source MD file name
timeline_v2.js-analysis.md (Source version)
Role
This file is the client-side source script handling dynamic navigation for the "Flex Timeline" view, using AJAX to fetch and display different time periods.
Key Technical Details
The key function is wpbc_flextimeline_nav(timeline_obj, nav_step). It initiates an AJAX POST request to admin-ajax.php using the action 'WPBC_FLEXTIMELINE_NAV'. The request payload includes timeline_obj, nav_step, and a security nonce (wpbc_nonce). Successful responses result in HTML injection into the container (.wpbc_timeline_ajax_replace).
Features (Admin vs User)
Enables core AJAX Timeline navigation. Supports the timeline component displayed on admin pages (e.g., Booking > Timeline) and supports the [bookingtimeline] shortcode functionality for visitors.
Top Extension Opportunities
The primary safe extension point is a custom jQuery event triggered at the start of the wpbc_flextimeline_nav function, allowing custom JavaScript execution before the AJAX request is sent.

3. css/calendar.css
core/timeline/v2/_out/timeline_v2.js
Source MD file name
timeline_v2.js-analysis.md (Output version)
Role
This is the distributed client-side script responsible for handling dynamic timeline navigation using AJAX. Its location in the _out directory suggests it is a compiled or generated asset.
Key Technical Details
It utilizes the same primary function, wpbc_flextimeline_nav, and communicates with the backend via the AJAX action 'WPBC_FLEXTIMELINE_NAV'. It uses the global wpbc_url_ajax variable and retrieves a security nonce from the DOM.
Features (Admin vs User)
Enables core AJAX Timeline navigation for front-end users using shortcodes/blocks, and provides the client-side logic for the timeline view on Admin pages.
Top Extension Opportunities
The safest way to extend is by using the custom jQuery event triggered at the function's start. Direct editing is forbidden as manual changes will be overwritten upon plugin compilation.

3. js/wpbc_time-selector.js
core/timeline/v2/wpbc-class-timeline_v2.php
Source MD file name
wpbc-class-timeline_v2.php-analysis.md
Role
Defines the WPBC_TimelineFlex class, the core PHP engine responsible for fetching data and rendering the complex, Gantt-chart-like visual Timeline representation.
Key Technical Details
The class supports initialization via three methods: admin_init(), client_init($attr) (for shortcodes), and ajax_init($attr) (for navigation). It does not interact with the database directly; instead, it calls the global function wpbc_get_bookings_objects(). The complex method wpbc_get_dates_and_times_for_timeline() processes raw booking data into structured arrays, using sophisticated logic to handle check-in/out times based on the "seconds" component of the time field (:01 for check-in, :02 for check-out).
Features (Admin vs User)
Renders the entire timeline on the Admin panel via the Booking > Timeline page. Provides the backend logic for the [bookingtimeline] shortcode. Supports a Customer-Specific View when passed a booking_hash parameter.
Top Extension Opportunities
The most viable extension point is to use the numerous filters inside wpbc_get_bookings_objects() (in core/admin/wpbc-sql.php) to modify the SQL query and data before it reaches the timeline class. Direct modification of the class is strongly discouraged due to the complexity and interdependence of the data processing logic.

Common Features and Patterns
Several consistent architectural and technical patterns are visible across the analyzed files:
1. Separation of Concerns and Refactoring: The existence of core/timeline/flex-timeline.php shows a pattern of maintaining original paths for backward compatibility while delegating all active logic to a modern v2/ subdirectory.
2. Source vs. Output Architecture: The consistent use of _src (source) and _out (generated/distributed) directories for both CSS and JavaScript files is a modern development practice. The minified CSS file is explicitly labeled as a build artifact intended for performance optimization.
3. Data Abstraction: The core PHP class WPBC_TimelineFlex avoids direct database queries, instead relying on the global data-access function wpbc_get_bookings_objects(). This centralization of data access is critical for maintenance and extension via filtering.
4. Modern UI Implementation: The timeline relies heavily on modern client-side techniques:
    ◦ AJAX Integration: All timeline navigation (client-side and admin-side) is handled via AJAX requests using the specific action WPBC_FLEXTIMELINE_NAV, avoiding full page reloads.
    ◦ Advanced CSS: The visual rendering utilizes CSS Custom Properties for easy theming and CSS Flexbox for a responsive and robust layout.
5. Extension Philosophy: There is a strong, recurring warning against modifying core files directly, especially generated files (like timeline_v2.1.min.css and timeline_v2.js in _out) and complex PHP files (like wpbc-class-timeline_v2.php). The plugin relies on external hooks/filters (in JS) or filters in the data layer (in PHP) for safe extension.
Extension Opportunities
Based on the analysis, the safest and most effective extension points focus on data filtering, client-side behavior interception, and styling overrides, rather than direct file modification.
Area
Opportunity
Description
Source(s)
PHP Data Layer
Filter wpbc_get_bookings_objects()
This is the most viable method to modify, add, or filter booking data before it is processed and rendered by the timeline engine.
JavaScript/UX
Custom jQuery Event Hook
A custom jQuery event is triggered at the start of wpbc_flextimeline_nav(). Hooking into this allows executing custom JavaScript, modifying the AJAX request payload, or adding UI changes before navigation occurs.
Styling/Theming
Override CSS Custom Properties
The defined CSS variables (e.g., --wpbc_timeline-booking-approved-color) can be easily overridden in a custom stylesheet, allowing for seamless color scheme changes across the entire timeline.
Styling/Specifics
Specific CSS Selector Overrides
Writing more specific CSS rules in an external stylesheet is a safe way to adjust elements not controlled by CSS variables.
